# 3.3 Compare and contrast concepts and strategies to protect data

This module delves into the critical aspects of data protection, covering different data types, classification schemes, general considerations for data handling, and various methods used to secure data throughout its lifecycle. Effective data protection is fundamental to maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Data Types

Understanding different data types helps in assessing their value and required protection.

* **Regulated:**
    * **Description:** Data protected by laws, regulations, or industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties.
    * **Protection Focus:** Strict access controls, encryption, auditing, specific retention policies, and often geographic restrictions.
* **Trade secret:**
    * **Description:** Confidential business information that provides a competitive edge (e.g., recipes, formulas, manufacturing processes, customer lists).
    * **Protection Focus:** Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), strong access controls, physical security, intellectual property protection laws.
* **Intellectual property (IP):**
    * **Description:** Creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. Protected by patents, copyrights, and trademarks.
    * **Protection Focus:** Access controls, digital rights management (DRM), legal protection, prevention of unauthorized copying or distribution.
* **Legal information:**
    * **Description:** Data related to legal cases, contracts, litigation, and regulatory compliance.
    * **Protection Focus:** Strict confidentiality, integrity (chain of custody), access controls, and retention policies to meet legal discovery requirements.
* **Financial information:**
    * **Description:** Data related to monetary transactions, bank accounts, credit card numbers, payroll, and investment records.
    * **Protection Focus:** Strong encryption, access controls, compliance with financial regulations (e.g., PCI DSS), fraud detection, and transactional integrity.
* **Human and non-human-readable:**
    * **Human-readable:** Data presented in a format understandable by humans (e.g., plain text documents, images, videos).
    * **Non-human-readable:** Data in machine-specific formats (e.g., binary executables, encrypted files, database files) that requires specific software or processing to be understood by humans.
    * **Protection Focus:** Human-readable data is often easier to exfiltrate and interpret directly. Non-human-readable data still needs protection but might require more sophisticated tools for an attacker to make sense of it. Both require robust security measures.

## Data Classifications

Categorizing data based on its sensitivity and business impact helps determine appropriate security controls.

* **Sensitive:**
    * **Description:** Data that, if exposed, could cause significant harm or loss to an individual or organization (e.g., PII, PHI, financial records).
    * **Protection Focus:** Highest level of protection, strict access, encryption, strong authentication.
* **Confidential:**
    * **Description:** Data that is not intended for public disclosure and whose unauthorized disclosure could cause moderate to severe harm (e.g., business strategies, internal memos).
    * **Protection Focus:** Restricted access, encryption, need-to-know basis.
* **Public:**
    * **Description:** Data intended for public consumption and whose disclosure causes no harm (e.g., marketing materials, press releases).
    * **Protection Focus:** Minimal security, but integrity and availability are still important.
* **Restricted:**
    * **Description:** Data that is highly sensitive and access is severely limited, often requiring explicit authorization (e.g., top-secret government documents, highly proprietary research).
    * **Protection Focus:** Extremely strict controls, often requiring air-gapping, multi-factor authentication, physical security, and legal agreements.
* **Private:**
    * **Description:** Data pertaining to individuals that is not public record and whose disclosure could harm privacy (often overlaps with PII).
    * **Protection Focus:** Compliance with privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA), strong access controls, encryption, consent management.
* **Critical:**
    * **Description:** Data essential for the core operations or survival of the organization, whose loss or unavailability would cause immediate and severe business disruption.
    * **Protection Focus:** High availability, robust backups, disaster recovery planning, integrity controls.

## General Data Considerations

## Data States

   ### Data at Rest

**Description:**  
Data stored on physical or virtual media (e.g., hard drives, USB drives, backups, databases).

**Risks:**  
- Unauthorized access  
- Data theft  
- Loss due to device compromise or theft

**Protection Measures:**  
- Full-disk encryption  
- File-level encryption  
- Access controls (e.g., role-based access)  
- Physical security of storage devices

---

   ### Data in Transit

**Description:**  
Data moving between systems, users, or devices (e.g., emails, file transfers, API requests).

**Risks:**  
- Interception  
- Man-in-the-middle attacks  
- Tampering

**Protection Measures:**  
- TLS/SSL encryption  
- VPN tunnels  
- Secure file transfer protocols (e.g., SFTP)  
- Network segmentation and firewalls

---

   ### Data in Use

**Description:**  
Data being actively processed by applications or accessed by users (e.g., in RAM, during computations).

**Risks:**  
- Memory scraping  
- Unauthorized access  
- Malware

**Protection Measures:**  
- Endpoint protection  
- Access monitoring  
- Secure coding practices  
- Trusted execution environments (TEE)
