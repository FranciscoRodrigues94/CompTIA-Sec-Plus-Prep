## Resilience and Recovery in Security Architecture

### High availability

* **Purpose:** To ensure that systems and services remain operational and accessible for a very high percentage of the time, minimizing downtime and service interruptions.
* **Load balancing vs. clustering:**
    * **Load balancing:**
        * **Description:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources.
        * **Purpose:** Improves resource utilization, maximizes throughput, reduces response time, and ensures high availability by directing traffic away from unhealthy servers. If one server fails, traffic is seamlessly redirected to others.
    * **Clustering:**
        * **Description:** A group of independent computers that work together as a single system to provide high availability and scalability. Often involves shared storage and failover mechanisms.
        * **Purpose:** Provides redundancy and fault tolerance. If one node (server) in the cluster fails, another node automatically takes over its workload without interruption.

### Site considerations

Planning for disaster recovery across different physical locations.

* **Hot site:**
    * **Description:** A fully equipped, operational replica of the primary data center, with all necessary hardware, software, and data. It's ready to take over operations almost immediately (hours).
    * **Purpose:** Provides the fastest recovery time objective (RTO) and lowest recovery point objective (RPO) for critical systems, ensuring near-instantaneous business continuity.
* **Cold site:**
    * **Description:** A basic facility with power and cooling, but no hardware, software, or data. It requires significant setup time (days to weeks) to become operational.
    * **Purpose:** A cost-effective option for less critical systems that can tolerate longer downtime, providing a barebones location for recovery.
* **Warm site:**
    * **Description:** A partially equipped site with some hardware and software, and possibly periodic data backups. It requires some configuration and data restoration but can be operational faster than a cold site (days).
    * **Purpose:** A balance between cost and recovery time, suitable for systems that need to be recovered within a few days but are not strictly critical enough for a hot site.
* **Geographic dispersion:**
    * **Description:** Distributing data centers or recovery sites across widely separated geographical locations.
    * **Purpose:** Mitigates region-wide disasters (e.g., natural disasters, large-scale power outages, regional cyberattacks) by ensuring that a single event cannot incapacitate all operational sites.

### Platform diversity

* **Purpose:** Using different operating systems, vendors, or technology stacks for critical systems or backup infrastructure.
* **Security Implication:** Reduces the impact of a single vulnerability or attack that targets a specific platform. If one system is compromised, others running on a different platform may remain secure.

### Multi-cloud systems

* **Purpose:** Utilizing cloud services from multiple cloud providers simultaneously.
* **Security Implication:** Enhances resilience by avoiding vendor lock-in and reducing the risk of a single cloud provider outage or security breach impacting all operations. Can also optimize for specific services or compliance needs across providers.

### Continuity of operations (COOP)

* **Purpose:** A plan to ensure that an organization can continue to perform its essential functions during and after a wide range of emergencies, including cyberattacks. It focuses on the ongoing operations and functions rather than just IT systems.
* **Security Implication:** Integrates security into overall business resilience, ensuring that critical business processes can continue even if parts of the IT infrastructure are compromised or unavailable.

### Capacity planning

* **Purpose:** Assessing and forecasting the resources needed (people, technology, infrastructure) to meet current and future demands, including those during a disaster or security incident.
* **People:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensuring adequate staffing with necessary skills are available for recovery efforts (e.g., incident response teams, backup administrators).
* **Technology:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensuring sufficient hardware, software licenses, and network bandwidth are available at recovery sites or for scaling during incidents.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * **Purpose:** Planning for adequate data center space, power, cooling, and network connectivity for recovery operations.
* **Security Implication:** Ensures that an organization has the resources to maintain security services, recover from attacks, and continue operations without being overwhelmed.

### Testing

Regularly validating resilience and recovery capabilities.

* **Tabletop exercises:**
    * **Description:** A discussion-based exercise where participants talk through a simulated security incident or disaster scenario, identifying roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes.
    * **Purpose:** To improve understanding of plans, identify gaps, and foster communication without actual system disruption.
* **Fail over:**
    * **Description:** Testing the automated process of switching to a redundant or standby system when the primary system fails.
    * **Purpose:** To confirm that redundant systems work as intended and that the transition to backup resources is smooth and successful, ensuring high availability.
* **Simulation:**
    * **Description:** A more hands-on exercise involving the actual use of backup systems or recovery procedures in a controlled environment, without impacting production systems.
    * **Purpose:** To test specific recovery processes and validate their effectiveness in a realistic but isolated setting.
* **Parallel processing:**
    * **Description:** Running critical workloads on both primary and backup/recovery systems simultaneously.
    * **Purpose:** To ensure that the backup environment is continuously updated and capable of handling live traffic if a switch becomes necessary, minimizing data loss and downtime.

### Backups

Creating copies of data for recovery in case of loss or corruption.

* **Onsite/offsite:**
    * **Onsite:** Backups stored at the same physical location as the primary data. Faster recovery but vulnerable to local disasters.
    * **Offsite:** Backups stored at a geographically separate location. Slower recovery but protected from local disasters impacting the primary site.
    * **Purpose:** To balance speed of recovery with protection against site-specific events.
* **Frequency:**
    * **Description:** How often backups are performed (e.g., daily, hourly, continuous).
    * **Purpose:** Directly impacts the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), determining how much data might be lost in a disaster. Higher frequency means lower data loss.
* **Encryption:**
    * **Purpose:** Encrypting backup data to protect its confidentiality both at rest (on storage media) and in transit (if moved over a network).
* **Snapshots:**
    * **Description:** A point-in-time copy of a virtual machine or a volume. It captures the state and data of a system at a specific moment.
    * **Purpose:** Facilitates quick recovery to a previous state, useful for rolling back from errors, malware infections, or configuration changes.
* **Recovery:**
    * **Purpose:** The process of restoring data and systems from backups after an incident. This is the ultimate goal of backing up data.
* **Replication:**
    * **Description:** The continuous or near real-time copying of data from a primary location to a secondary location.
    * **Purpose:** Provides a very low RPO, often used for critical data, as it ensures the secondary copy is almost identical to the primary.
* **Journaling:**
    * **Description:** A file system feature that logs changes to data before they are written to the main file system.
    * **Purpose:** Helps maintain data consistency and integrity, allowing for faster recovery from crashes or power failures by easily rolling back or replaying transactions.

### Power

Ensuring uninterrupted power supply for critical systems.

* **Generators:**
    * **Purpose:** Provide long-term backup power in the event of a utility power outage, typically used for entire data centers or critical facilities.
* **Uninterruptible power supply (UPS):**
    * **Purpose:** Provides immediate, short-term backup power during utility power fluctuations or outages, allowing critical systems to shut down gracefully or for generators to start.
* **Security Implication:** Consistent and clean power is vital for system uptime and data integrity. Power disruptions can cause data corruption, system crashes, and lead to availability issues that attackers could potentially exploit.
