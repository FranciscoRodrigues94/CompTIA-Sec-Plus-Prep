# 3.2 Given a scenario, apply security principles to secure enterprise infrastructure

This module focuses on practical application of security principles to design and implement secure enterprise infrastructure. It covers considerations for device placement, network segmentation, various security appliances, and secure communication methods.

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Device placement

* **Purpose:** Strategically positioning network devices and security controls to maximize their effectiveness in protecting assets and controlling traffic flow.
* **Security Implication:** Proper placement (e.g., firewalls at network boundaries, WAFs in front of web servers, IPS/IDS sensors at key choke points) is crucial for enforcing security policies and detecting threats. Poor placement can leave gaps or render controls ineffective.

### Security zones

* **Purpose:** To segment a network into areas with different security requirements and trust levels, controlling traffic flow between them.
* **Examples:**
    * **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** A buffer network segment between an internal network and an external network (e.g., the internet) where publicly accessible servers (web, email, DNS) are placed. Its purpose is to allow external access to these services while protecting the internal network if the public-facing servers are compromised.
    * **Internal LAN:** The trusted corporate network.
    * **Wireless Network:** Often a separate zone with stricter access controls.
    * **Guest Network:** Highly restricted zone for visitors.
* **Security Implication:** Enforces the principle of least privilege in network communication, limiting lateral movement for attackers.

### Attack surface

* **Purpose:** To understand and identify all possible entry points or areas where an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.
* **Security Implication:** Minimizing the attack surface (e.g., by disabling unused ports/services, removing unnecessary software, patching vulnerabilities) directly reduces the opportunities for attackers.

### Connectivity

* **Purpose:** How different network segments, devices, and systems are linked together.
* **Security Implication:** Involves securing the physical connections, implementing proper routing and switching, and ensuring that communication paths are necessary and secure. Uncontrolled or excessive connectivity can create pathways for attackers.

### Failure modes

How a system or component behaves when it fails.

* **Fail-open:**
    * **Purpose:** When a security device fails, it allows traffic to pass through without inspection or blocking.
    * **Security Implication:** Prioritizes availability over security. While it prevents service disruption, it leaves the network vulnerable during the failure. Often used where business continuity is paramount (e.g., a critical production line).
* **Fail-closed:**
    * **Purpose:** When a security device fails, it blocks all traffic.
    * **Security Implication:** Prioritizes security over availability. It prevents unauthorized access during a failure but may cause service disruption. Preferred for highly sensitive systems where security is paramount (e.g., financial transactions, classified networks).

### Device attribute

How devices are deployed and operate within the network.

* **Active vs. passive:**
    * **Active:** Security devices that actively intervene in traffic flow (e.g., firewalls, IPS). They can block, modify, or redirect traffic.
    * **Passive:** Security devices that monitor traffic without directly interfering (e.g., IDS, sensors, sniffers). They detect and alert but do not block.
* **Inline vs. tap/monitor:**
    * **Inline:** A device deployed directly in the path of network traffic, meaning all traffic flows through it. This allows for active intervention (e.g., IPS, firewalls). If the device fails, it impacts traffic flow.
    * **Tap/monitor:** A device that receives a copy of network traffic for analysis, without being directly in the traffic path. This is typical for IDSs and network sniffers. It provides visibility without affecting traffic flow if the device fails.

### Network appliances

Dedicated hardware or software devices designed to perform specific network security functions.

* **Jump server (Bastion host):**
    * **Purpose:** A hardened and monitored server that acts as an intermediary for administrators to connect to other servers within a secured network (e.g., data center, production environment).
    * **Security Implication:** Reduces the attack surface by limiting direct administrative access to sensitive internal systems, providing a single point of control and logging for privileged access.
* **Proxy server:**
    * **Purpose:** A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. Can be used for web filtering, caching, or anonymization.
    * **Security Implication:** Enhances security by hiding client IP addresses, enforcing web access policies, inspecting traffic for malware, and potentially providing authentication services.
* **Intrusion prevention system (IPS)/intrusion detection system (IDS):**
    * **Purpose:**
        * **IDS (Detection):** Monitors network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations and generates alerts.
        * **IPS (Prevention):** Detects and actively blocks or prevents detected malicious activities in real-time.
    * **Security Implication:** Provides active defense and crucial threat detection, protecting against known attack signatures and anomalous behavior.
* **Load balancer:**
    * **Purpose:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers.
    * **Security Implication:** Improves availability and performance. Can also offer security benefits by handling SSL/TLS offloading, providing a single point of entry, and hiding backend server details, reducing their direct exposure.
* **Sensors:**
    * **Purpose:** Devices or software components deployed within a network or system to collect data (e.g., traffic, logs, system events) for security monitoring and analysis.
    * **Security Implication:** Provides visibility into network and system activity, essential for detecting threats that bypass other controls, and for forensic analysis.

### Port security

* **Purpose:** To secure individual physical ports on network switches to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
* **802.1X:**
    * **Purpose:** A port-based network access control (NAC) standard that provides authenticated network access to wired and wireless networks. It requires devices to authenticate to an authentication server (e.g., RADIUS) before being granted network access.
* **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP):**
    * **Purpose:** A universal authentication framework used in 802.1X for various authentication methods. It doesn't define the authentication method itself but supports multiple methods, allowing for strong, flexible authentication over wired and wireless networks.
* **Security Implication:** Prevents unauthorized devices from gaining network access, even if they physically plug into a network jack.

### Firewall types

Devices or software that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

* **Web application firewall (WAF):**
    * **Purpose:** Specifically designed to protect web applications from common web-based attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet.
* **Unified threat management (UTM):**
    * **Purpose:** An all-in-one security appliance that combines multiple security functions (e.g., firewall, IDS/IPS, antivirus, content filtering, VPN) into a single device.
* **Next-generation firewall (NGFW):**
    * **Purpose:** Goes beyond traditional port/protocol inspection by integrating advanced capabilities such as deep packet inspection, application awareness, intrusion prevention, and threat intelligence feeds.
* **Layer 4/Layer 7 (Firewall capabilities):**
    * **Layer 4 (Transport Layer):** Filters traffic based on source/destination IP addresses and port numbers (e.g., TCP/UDP ports).
    * **Layer 7 (Application Layer):** Filters traffic based on the actual application content (e.g., HTTP headers, specific commands within an application protocol).
* **Security Implication:** Firewalls are foundational security controls, enforcing network boundaries and access policies, and protecting against a wide range of network-based attacks. WAFs are crucial for web application security.

## Secure Communication/Access

Methods for protecting data in transit and ensuring secure remote connectivity.

* **Virtual private network (VPN):**
    * **Purpose:** To create a secure, encrypted tunnel over an unsecured network (like the internet), allowing remote users or branch offices to securely access a private network as if they were directly connected.
* **Remote access:**
    * **Purpose:** To allow users to connect to and control systems or networks from a remote location.
    * **Security Implication:** Must be secured with strong authentication (MFA), encryption, and strict access controls to prevent unauthorized remote access.
* **Tunneling:**
    * **Purpose:** Encapsulating one network protocol within another. This allows data to travel securely or traverse networks it normally wouldn't.
        * **Transport Layer Security (TLS):**
            * **Purpose:** A cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network (e.g., for web Browse - HTTPS). It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
        * **Internet protocol security (IPSec):**
            * **Purpose:** A suite of protocols used to secure IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session. Used for VPNs, especially site-to-site.
* **Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN):**
    * **Purpose:** An architecture that centralizes control of WAN traffic management, allowing organizations to route traffic across various transport services (e.g., broadband, MPLS) based on application policy.
    * **Security Implication:** Can enhance security by providing centralized policy enforcement, segmentation, and built-in encryption for WAN traffic, often simplifying security management across distributed sites.
* **Secure access service edge (SASE):**
    * **Purpose:** A cloud-based security model that converges wide area networking (WAN) and network security services (e.g., SD-WAN, SWG, CASB, ZTNA, Firewall-as-a-Service) into a single, cloud-delivered platform.
    * **Security Implication:** Aims to provide secure, flexible access regardless of user location, enforcing consistent security policies at the edge closest to the user or device, reducing the need for traditional perimeter security.

## Selection of Effective Controls

* **Purpose:** The process of choosing the most appropriate and effective security measures (technical, administrative, physical) to mitigate identified risks based on the organization's specific needs, risk appetite, resources, and compliance requirements.
* **Security Implication:** An effective selection process ensures that security investments are optimized, covering the highest risks with the most suitable controls, leading to a strong and efficient security posture. It involves understanding threats, vulnerabilities, and the trade-offs of different solutions.
