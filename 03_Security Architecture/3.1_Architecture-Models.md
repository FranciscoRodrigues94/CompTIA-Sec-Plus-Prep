## Architecture and Infrastructure Concepts

### Cloud

A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

* **Responsibility matrix (Shared Responsibility Model):**
    * **Description:** Defines the security duties of the cloud provider vs. the cloud customer. Generally, the cloud provider is responsible for the "security *of* the cloud" (physical infrastructure, network, virtualization), while the customer is responsible for the "security *in* the cloud" (data, applications, configurations, identity & access management).
    * **Security Implications:** Misunderstanding this model is a leading cause of cloud breaches. Customers must actively manage their portion of the responsibility (e.g., proper configuration, data encryption, strong IAM).
* **Hybrid considerations:**
    * **Description:** A mix of on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud services with orchestration between the platforms.
    * **Security Implications:** Increased complexity in managing consistent security policies, identity, data flow, and network connectivity across disparate environments. Requires robust integration of security controls.
* **Third-party vendors:**
    * **Description:** Reliance on external organizations for cloud services, managed services, or software.
    * **Security Implications:** Introduces supply chain risk. Security posture is dependent on the vendor's security practices, requiring thorough due diligence, contractual agreements (SLAs, security addendums), and continuous monitoring of vendor security.

### Infrastructure as code (IaC)

* **Description:** Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. Configurations are defined in version-controlled scripts or templates (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
* **Security Implications:** Enables consistency and repeatability, reducing human error from manual configurations. Allows for security policies to be codified and automatically enforced (security by design). However, vulnerabilities in IaC templates can be propagated quickly across the entire infrastructure. Requires secure coding practices for templates and version control.

### Serverless

* **Description:** A cloud execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Developers write and deploy code (functions) without managing underlying infrastructure (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).
* **Security Implications:** Reduces OS/patch management burden on the customer. However, new attack surfaces emerge (function code vulnerabilities, API gateway security, data leakage via temporary storage, dependency on provider security). Granular permissions for functions are critical.

### Microservices

* **Description:** An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
* **Security Implications:** Each microservice can have its own vulnerabilities and dependencies, potentially increasing the attack surface. However, failure or compromise of one service might not impact others. Requires robust API security, inter-service communication security, and decentralized identity management. Complex to monitor and secure compared to monolithic applications.

### Network infrastructure

* **Description:** The hardware and software resources of an entire network that enable network connectivity, communication, operations, and management of an enterprise network (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls).
* **Security Implications:** Fundamental to all other architectures. Vulnerabilities in network devices (misconfigurations, outdated firmware, open ports) can expose the entire enterprise. Proper network segmentation, robust access controls, and regular auditing are crucial.

### Physical isolation

* **Description:** Completely separating a network or system from other networks, especially the internet, to prevent unauthorized access.
    * **Air-gapped:**
        * **Description:** A security measure that involves isolating a computer or network from other networks, especially the public internet, by ensuring there is no physical or logical connection.
        * **Security Implications:** Offers the highest level of security against external cyber threats for highly sensitive systems (e.g., industrial control systems, classified networks). However, introduces operational challenges (e.g., manual data transfer via removable media, insider threat remains).
* **Logical segmentation:**
    * **Description:** Dividing a single physical network into multiple logical network segments (e.g., using VLANs, subnets, firewall rules) to separate different types of traffic or systems.
    * **Security Implications:** Limits the scope of a breach (containment), enforces policy-based access between segments, and simplifies security management. Improves internal security posture.
* **Software-defined networking (SDN):**
    * **Description:** An architecture that decouples the network control plane from the data plane, enabling network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted from applications and network services.
    * **Security Implications:** Centralized control can improve policy enforcement and visibility, enabling faster response to threats. However, the centralized controller becomes a critical single point of failure and a high-value target for attackers.

### On-premises

* **Description:** IT infrastructure (servers, storage, networking) that is deployed, managed, and hosted within the organization's own physical data center.
* **Security Implications:** Full control over security measures and data. Requires significant upfront investment and ongoing operational costs for hardware, software, power, cooling, and security staff. Responsibility for all security aspects lies solely with the organization.

### Centralized vs. decentralized

* **Centralized:**
    * **Description:** Resources, processing, or control are located at a single, central point.
    * **Security Implications:** Easier to manage security policies and apply updates from a single point. However, the central point becomes a single point of failure and a high-value target for attackers.
* **Decentralized:**
    * **Description:** Resources, processing, or control are distributed across multiple locations or systems.
    * **Security Implications:** No single point of failure, increasing resilience. Attacks might be contained to specific parts of the system. However, managing consistent security policies and monitoring across distributed systems can be more complex.

### Containerization

* **Description:** A lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies into a standalone executable package (container) that can run consistently across different environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
* **Security Implications:** Provides process isolation, but not the same level of isolation as VMs. Shared OS kernel is a risk. Vulnerabilities in base images, misconfigured containers, or insecure container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) are common issues. Image scanning and secure registry practices are crucial.

### Virtualization

* **Description:** Creating a virtual version of a resource, such as a server, storage device, network, or operating system, from a single physical piece of hardware.
* **Security Implications:** Allows for efficient resource utilization and easier disaster recovery. However, a compromise of the hypervisor (the software that runs VMs) can lead to a VM escape, impacting all guest VMs. Proper hypervisor hardening, segmentation of VMs, and secure management interfaces are essential.

### IoT (Internet of Things)

* **Description:** A network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
* **Security Implications:** Often lack strong security features (e.g., default passwords, unpatchable firmware, limited processing power for encryption). Large attack surface due to sheer number of devices. Lack of updates and insecure communication protocols are common. Can be easily compromised and used in botnets (e.g., for DDoS attacks).

### Industrial control systems (ICS)/supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)

* **Description:** Systems used to control industrial processes (e.g., power grids, water treatment plants, manufacturing). SCADA systems collect data and control equipment in large-scale processes.
* **Security Implications:** Often rely on legacy systems, proprietary protocols, and may not support modern security controls (e.g., patching, antivirus). Cybersecurity attacks can have severe physical consequences (safety, environmental, economic). Air-gapping, strong network segmentation (DMZs), and specific ICS security standards are critical.

### Real-time operating system (RTOS)

* **Description:** An operating system intended to serve real-time applications that process data with strict time constraints (e.g., in embedded systems, robotics, aerospace).
* **Security Implications:** Designed for predictability and performance, often sacrificing security features (e.g., memory protection, robust authentication). Vulnerabilities can lead to critical system failures or safety hazards if exploited. Patching can be challenging due to strict timing requirements.

### Embedded systems

* **Description:** Computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints (e.g., in smart cars, medical devices, smart appliances).
* **Security Implications:** Similar to IoT, often have limited resources, fixed functions, and may not be designed with security as a primary concern. Updates are difficult or impossible. Physical tampering is also a significant concern.

### High availability

* **Description:** A system design approach that aims to ensure a very high level of operational performance for a given period, meaning the system is operational for a very high percentage of the time. Achieved through redundancy, failover, and fault tolerance.
* **Security Implications:** While not a security control itself, high availability can contribute to security by ensuring services remain accessible even during certain types of attacks (e.g., partial DoS) or component failures, thereby reducing the impact of security incidents on business continuity. However, redundant systems must also be secured equally.

## Considerations

Factors to evaluate when selecting or designing security for different architecture models.

* **Availability:**
    * **Description:** The ability of an authorized user to access information and resources when needed.
    * **Security Implication:** Ensuring protection against DoS attacks, hardware failures, and other disruptions. Different architectures offer varying levels of inherent availability and require different mechanisms (e.g., redundancy, load balancing).
* **Resilience:**
    * **Description:** The ability of a system to recover gracefully from failures, attacks, or adverse conditions and continue to operate, possibly at a reduced capacity.
    * **Security Implication:** How quickly and effectively an architecture can bounce back from a security breach or system failure without catastrophic loss of service or data. Cloud and highly virtualized environments often offer more built-in resilience.
* **Cost:**
    * **Description:** The financial outlay for implementing and maintaining the security architecture, including hardware, software, personnel, and operational expenses.
    * **Security Implication:** Balancing security investment with risk tolerance and budget constraints. Cloud models shift CapEx to OpEx, but can incur higher ongoing costs if not managed. On-premises requires significant upfront CapEx.
* **Responsiveness:**
    * **Description:** How quickly an architecture can react to changes in demand, threats, or new requirements.
    * **Security Implication:** The ability to rapidly deploy security patches, implement new security controls, or scale defenses in response to emerging threats. Cloud and IaC models typically offer higher responsiveness.
* **Scalability:**
    * **Description:** The ability of a system to handle increasing workloads or demands efficiently, by either adding resources (scaling up) or distributing the load across more resources (scaling out).
    * **Security Implication:** An architecture that can scale ensures that security controls can also scale with the infrastructure, preventing new points of weakness as the system grows. Crucial for handling traffic spikes from legitimate use or DoS attacks.
* **Ease of deployment:**
    * **Description:** How simple and quick it is to set up and configure the security infrastructure and deploy applications within it.
    * **Security Implication:** Simpler deployment can reduce misconfiguration errors and accelerate the implementation of security features. IaC, containerization, and serverless often offer high ease of deployment.
* **Risk transference:**
    * **Description:** Shifting the financial burden or responsibility of a risk to another party, often through insurance or by using a third-party service provider (e.g., cloud provider).
    * **Security Implication:** While responsibility for "security of the cloud" is transferred to the provider, accountability for "security in the cloud" remains with the customer. It's not a complete transfer of all security risk.
* **Ease of recovery:**
    * **Description:** How quickly and efficiently a system or data can be restored to a functional state after an outage, attack, or data loss.
    * **Security Implication:** Architectures designed for quick recovery (e.g., with robust backup and disaster recovery plans, automated failover) reduce the impact duration of security incidents.
* **Patch availability:**
    * **Description:** The regularity and timeliness with which security updates and patches are released by vendors for systems and applications within the architecture.
    * **Security Implication:** High patch availability ensures that known vulnerabilities can be quickly addressed, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.
* **Inability to patch:**
    * **Description:** Situations where systems or applications cannot be patched due to being End-of-Life (EOL), proprietary, too critical to take offline, or embedded.
    * **Security Implication:** Creates persistent vulnerabilities. Requires compensatory controls (e.g., network segmentation, IDS/IPS, virtual patching) to protect these vulnerable assets. Common in ICS/SCADA and legacy systems.
* **Power:**
    * **Description:** The provision of continuous and stable electrical power to all components of the architecture.
    * **Security Implication:** Loss of power can lead to system downtime (availability issue) or data corruption (integrity issue). Requires redundancy (e.g., UPS, generators) to maintain security services and prevent uncontrolled shutdowns during an incident.
* **Compute:**
    * **Description:** The processing power and resources available within the architecture to run applications and services.
    * **Security Implication:** Sufficient compute resources are needed not only for applications but also for security tools (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption/decryption) to operate effectively without causing performance bottlenecks or becoming single points of failure under load (e.g., during a DoS attack).
