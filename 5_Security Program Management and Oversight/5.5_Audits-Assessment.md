# 5.5 Explain types and purposes of audits and assessments

This module explores the various types and purposes of audits and assessments in the context of information security. Audits and assessments are crucial for evaluating an organization's security posture, ensuring compliance, identifying vulnerabilities, and verifying the effectiveness of controls.

## Types and Purposes of Audits and Assessments

**Audits and Assessments** are systematic evaluations of an organization's security posture, controls, and compliance with established criteria.

### Attestation

* **Description:** A formal declaration or certification by an independent third party that a set of controls or processes (e.g., security controls) are in place and operating effectively, often against a recognized standard (e.g., SOC 2 report, ISO 27001 certification).
* **Purpose:** Provides assurance to stakeholders (customers, partners, regulators) that an organization's stated security practices are indeed implemented and effective. It builds trust and can be a requirement for business dealings.

### Internal

Audits and assessments conducted by an organization's own personnel or internal audit department.

* **Compliance:**
    * **Description:** An internal audit specifically focused on verifying adherence to internal policies, procedures, and external regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS).
    * **Purpose:** To proactively identify gaps in compliance before external audits, ensure ongoing adherence to requirements, and mitigate the risk of non-compliance penalties.
* **Audit committee:**
    * **Description:** A committee, typically composed of members of the board of directors, that oversees the organization's financial reporting and internal control systems, including internal audits.
    * **Purpose:** Provides independent oversight of audit functions, ensures audit findings are addressed, and enhances corporate governance.
* **Self-assessments:**
    * **Description:** An organization's own evaluation of its security posture or compliance against a set of criteria, without direct external involvement or formal internal audit.
    * **Purpose:** Helps organizations gain a preliminary understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and prepare for more formal audits. It's often a first step in a continuous improvement cycle.

### External

Audits and assessments conducted by parties independent of the organization.

* **Regulatory:**
    * **Description:** Audits mandated by government agencies or regulatory bodies to ensure an organization complies with specific laws or regulations applicable to its industry or operations (e.g., banking regulators, healthcare regulators).
    * **Purpose:** To enforce legal compliance, protect public interest, and ensure stability within regulated sectors. Failure to pass can result in fines or sanctions.
* **Examinations:**
    * **Description:** Often refers to a thorough review by a regulatory body, similar to an audit, focusing on specific areas or practices to ensure soundness and compliance. More common in financial services.
    * **Purpose:** To assess the overall health, stability, and compliance of an entity within a regulated industry.
* **Assessment:**
    * **Description:** A broad term for an evaluation of an organization's security posture, often against a framework (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework assessment), or a specific type of vulnerability assessment. It may not result in a formal opinion like an audit.
    * **Purpose:** To identify security gaps, measure maturity, and provide recommendations for improvement.
* **Independent third-party audit:**
    * **Description:** A formal audit conducted by an external, independent auditing firm to provide an objective opinion on the effectiveness of controls or compliance with standards (e.g., financial audit, SOC 2 audit).
    * **Purpose:** Provides unbiased assurance to external stakeholders and helps an organization demonstrate its commitment to security.

### Penetration testing

* **Description:** A simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or web application to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It actively attempts to exploit weaknesses.
    * **Physical:**
        * **Description:** Attempting to gain unauthorized physical access to facilities, data centers, or restricted areas using social engineering, lock picking, or other physical means.
        * **Purpose:** To identify weaknesses in physical security controls and procedures that could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive equipment or data.
    * **Offensive:**
        * **Description:** A type of penetration test where the testers adopt an adversarial mindset, aiming to break into systems, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services, similar to a real attacker.
        * **Purpose:** To identify exploitable vulnerabilities and assess the real-world impact of a successful attack.
    * **Defensive:**
        * **Description:** Focusing on evaluating the effectiveness of defensive security controls and the organization's ability to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks. Often involves red team/blue team exercises.
        * **Purpose:** To test and improve the organization's defensive capabilities, including security operations center (SOC) effectiveness and incident response.
    * **Integrated:**
        * **Description:** A penetration test that combines various approaches, often including physical, network, and application layers, and may incorporate elements of social engineering.
        * **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive assessment of the organization's security posture across multiple attack vectors.
    * **Known environment (White Box/Crystal Box):**
        * **Description:** The testers are provided with full knowledge of the target system's architecture, source code, network diagrams, and credentials.
        * **Purpose:** Allows for thorough testing of internal logic and configurations, often revealing specific coding or configuration flaws.
    * **Partially known environment (Grey Box):**
        * **Description:** The testers have some limited knowledge of the target environment, such as user-level credentials or network maps, simulating an insider threat or a persistent attacker.
        * **Purpose:** Provides a more realistic simulation of an attack by someone with some internal access or reconnaissance.
    * **Unknown environment (Black Box):**
        * **Description:** The testers have no prior knowledge of the target system, simulating an external attacker with no inside information.
        * **Purpose:** Best for assessing the external perimeter defenses and identifying vulnerabilities visible from the internet.
    * **Reconnaissance:**
        * **Description:** The phase of an attack or penetration test where information is gathered about the target.
            * **Passive:**
                * **Description:** Gathering information about the target without directly interacting with it (e.g., OSINT, public records, social media, DNS lookups).
                * **Purpose:** To collect information without alerting the target, minimizing detection risk.
            * **Active:**
                * **Description:** Gathering information by directly interacting with the target system or network (e.g., port scanning, vulnerability scanning, ping sweeps).
                * **Purpose:** To gain more specific and detailed information about the target's live systems, though it carries a higher risk of detection.
