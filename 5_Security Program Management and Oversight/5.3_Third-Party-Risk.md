# 5.3 Explain the processes associated with third-party risk assessment and management

This module covers the crucial processes involved in assessing and managing risks introduced by third-party vendors, partners, and suppliers. Effective third-party risk management is essential for extending an organization's security posture beyond its direct control and mitigating supply chain risks.

## Processes Associated with Third-Party Risk Assessment and Management

**Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with external entities that have access to an organization's systems, data, or processes.

### Vendor assessment

* **Description:** The process of evaluating a potential or existing vendor's security posture and risk profile.
    * **Penetration testing:**
        * **Description:** Asking the vendor to provide evidence of recent penetration tests conducted on their systems or, in some cases, performing a penetration test against the vendor's systems (with their explicit permission).
        * **Purpose:** To independently verify the vendor's ability to withstand simulated attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities in their infrastructure or applications.
    * **Right-to-audit clause:**
        * **Description:** A contractual provision that grants the client organization the right to audit the vendor's security controls, processes, and compliance directly or through an independent third party.
        * **Purpose:** Provides a mechanism for ongoing oversight and verification of the vendor's adherence to security requirements.
    * **Evidence of internal audits:**
        * **Description:** Requesting documentation of the vendor's own internal security audits, their findings, and remediation efforts.
        * **Purpose:** Demonstrates the vendor's commitment to internal security governance and continuous improvement.
    * **Independent assessments:**
        * **Description:** Obtaining reports from independent third-party assessments or certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA attestations) that validate the vendor's security controls.
        * **Purpose:** Provides objective assurance of the vendor's security maturity and compliance against recognized industry standards.
    * **Supply chain analysis:**
        * **Description:** Evaluating the security risks associated with the entire chain of suppliers that contribute to a vendor's product or service, not just the direct vendor.
        * **Purpose:** Addresses the cascading risk from sub-vendors or components, which could introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., software dependencies, hardware components).

### Vendor selection

* **Description:** The process of choosing appropriate third-party vendors based on business needs, cost, and risk factors, particularly security.
    * **Due diligence:**
        * **Description:** Conducting thorough research and investigation into a vendor's background, financial stability, reputation, and, critically, their security practices before engagement.
        * **Purpose:** To make informed decisions, minimize surprises, and ensure the vendor meets the organization's risk acceptance criteria.
    * **Conflict of interest:**
        * **Description:** Identifying situations where a vendor's interests might conflict with the organization's security objectives or lead to biased decisions.
        * **Purpose:** Ensures ethical dealings and prevents situations where a vendor might prioritize their own gain over the client's security.

### Agreement types

Legal contracts that define the terms and conditions of engagement with third parties, including security expectations.

* **Service-level agreement (SLA):**
    * **Description:** A contract between a service provider and a client that specifies the level of service expected, including performance metrics, uptime guarantees, and often security responsibilities.
    * **Security Implication:** Outlines specific security requirements (e.g., incident response times, data backup frequency, security control implementations) and penalties for non-compliance.
* **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):**
    * **Description:** A formal document expressing mutual assent of two or more parties regarding a common understanding or intent, often less formal than a contract but still outlines responsibilities.
    * **Security Implication:** Can establish general security commitments and shared understanding between parties before a more formal contract.
* **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):**
    * **Description:** Similar to an MOA, it's a non-binding agreement that describes the broad outlines of an agreement or mutual goals between two or more parties.
    * **Security Implication:** Used to lay the groundwork for collaboration and outline general security cooperation intentions.
* **Master Service Agreement (MSA):**
    * **Description:** A contract between two parties that sets out the terms that will govern future agreements and transactions. It establishes the overall legal and security framework for subsequent work orders.
    * **Security Implication:** Provides a foundational agreement for security, data handling, and liability that applies to all services provided under it.
* **Work Order (WO)/Statement of Work (SOW):**
    * **Description:** Detailed documents that specify the exact work to be performed, deliverables, timelines, and pricing under a broader MSA.
    * **Security Implication:** Translates the high-level security requirements from the MSA into specific security tasks, responsibilities, and deliverables for a particular project.
* **Non-disclosure agreement (NDA):**
    * **Description:** A legal contract that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another but restrict access to third parties.
    * **Security Implication:** Legally binds the third party to protect confidential information and defines consequences for unauthorized disclosure.
* **Business Partners Agreement (BPA):**
    * **Description:** A comprehensive legal agreement between two or more business partners defining responsibilities, profit/loss sharing, and potentially security obligations when sharing resources or data.
    * **Security Implication:** Specifies mutual security responsibilities, data sharing protocols, incident notification procedures, and liability related to shared business processes and data.

### Vendor monitoring

* **Description:** Ongoing oversight of a vendor's security posture and compliance throughout the duration of the relationship. This is not a one-time activity.
* **Purpose:** To ensure that vendors continuously adhere to agreed-upon security requirements and to detect any changes in their risk profile or security performance.

### Questionnaires

* **Description:** Standardized sets of questions used to gather information about a vendor's security controls, policies, and practices. (e.g., Shared Assessments Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaires).
* **Purpose:** A primary tool for initial and ongoing vendor assessment, allowing organizations to collect consistent data for comparison and risk analysis.

### Rules of engagement (ROE)

* **Description:** A document that specifies the boundaries, expectations, and methodologies for a security activity, particularly common in penetration testing or incident response with external parties.
* **Purpose:** Ensures that all parties involved in a third-party security assessment or incident response understand the scope, limitations, and acceptable actions, preventing misunderstandings or unintended consequences.
