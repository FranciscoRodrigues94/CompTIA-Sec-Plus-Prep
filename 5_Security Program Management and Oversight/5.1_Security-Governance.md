## Elements of Effective Security Governance

Security governance provides the framework and oversight to ensure an organization's security program is robust, compliant, and supports its mission.

### Guidelines

* **Description:** Recommended actions and instructions that help users and implementers comply with policies and standards. They offer flexibility and best practices rather than strict mandates.
* **Purpose:** To provide helpful, non-mandatory advice that promotes secure practices and helps individuals understand how to achieve policy objectives.

### Policies

* **Description:** High-level, formal statements issued by management that define the organization's security objectives, rules, and acceptable behaviors. Policies are mandatory.
    * **Acceptable use policy (AUP):**
        * **Description:** Defines the acceptable ways in which users can use the organization's information systems and resources.
        * **Security Implication:** Sets expectations for user behavior, reduces misuse of IT assets, and helps prevent actions that could compromise security (e.g., unauthorized software installation, visiting malicious websites).
    * **Information security policies:**
        * **Description:** A broad set of policies that govern how information is protected, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements across the organization.
        * **Security Implication:** Provides the overarching framework for all security activities, ensuring a consistent approach to protecting information assets.
    * **Business continuity (BC):**
        * **Description:** Policies outlining how an organization will continue critical business functions during and after a disaster or disruption.
        * **Security Implication:** Ensures that security is integrated into resilience planning, allowing for secure operations even in adverse conditions.
    * **Disaster recovery (DR):**
        * **Description:** Policies specifically detailing how to recover and restore IT systems and infrastructure after a disaster.
        * **Security Implication:** Guides the secure restoration of IT services, ensuring data integrity and system security post-disaster.
    * **Incident response (IR):**
        * **Description:** Policies defining the structured approach an organization takes to prepare for, detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from security incidents.
        * **Security Implication:** Ensures a swift, coordinated, and effective reaction to security breaches, minimizing damage and recovery time.
    * **Software development lifecycle (SDLC) security:**
        * **Description:** Policies that integrate security activities (e.g., security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding, security testing) into every phase of software development.
        * **Security Implication:** Reduces vulnerabilities in applications by building security in from the start ("security by design"), making it more cost-effective to fix flaws.
    * **Change management:**
        * **Description:** Policies governing the process for making controlled changes to IT systems, infrastructure, or applications.
        * **Security Implication:** Prevents unauthorized changes, reduces misconfigurations, minimizes the risk of introducing vulnerabilities, and ensures changes are documented and tested for security impact.

### Standards

* **Description:** Mandatory specifications or detailed rules that define how policies are to be implemented. They provide specific technical controls or configurations.
    * **Password:**
        * **Description:** Specific requirements for password length, complexity, age, history, and usage (e.g., minimum 14 characters, require special characters).
        * **Security Implication:** Enforces strong password practices, making accounts harder to compromise through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
    * **Access control:**
        * **Description:** Specific rules for how access to resources is granted, managed, and revoked (e.g., use of RBAC, principle of least privilege, specific naming conventions for groups).
        * **Security Implication:** Ensures consistent application of access policies, preventing unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
    * **Physical security:**
        * **Description:** Specifications for physical access controls (e.g., use of badge readers, CCTV, biometric scanners, secure server room access).
        * **Security Implication:** Protects physical assets and prevents unauthorized physical access to sensitive equipment and data.
    * **Encryption:**
        * **Description:** Standards for specific encryption algorithms, key lengths, and protocols to be used for data at rest and in transit (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit).
        * **Security Implication:** Ensures confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data, protecting it from unauthorized disclosure or tampering.

### Procedures

* **Description:** Detailed, step-by-step instructions for carrying out specific tasks or processes, ensuring consistent execution of standards and policies.
    * **Change management:**
        * **Description:** Step-by-step instructions for submitting, reviewing, approving, testing, and implementing changes to IT systems.
        * **Security Implication:** Ensures changes are systematic, documented, and reviewed for security impacts before implementation, reducing operational risks.
    * **Onboarding/offboarding:**
        * **Description:** Detailed steps for provisioning (onboarding) and de-provisioning (offboarding) user accounts and access rights when employees join or leave the organization.
        * **Security Implication:** Ensures new employees receive appropriate and timely access, while departing employees' access is revoked promptly, preventing unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
    * **Playbooks:**
        * **Description:** Detailed, step-by-step guides for responding to specific types of security incidents or common operational tasks.
        * **Security Implication:** Standardizes incident response, ensures consistent and efficient handling of security events, and reduces reliance on individual expertise during crises.

### External considerations
