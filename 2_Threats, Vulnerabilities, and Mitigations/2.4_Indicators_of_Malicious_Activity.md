## Indicators of Malicious Activity by Attack Type

### Malware attacks

Indicators that malicious software is present and active.

* **Ransomware:**
    * **Indicators:** Files encrypted with unusual extensions (e.g., .locked, .crypt), ransom notes appearing on desktop or in folders, inability to access files, pop-up windows demanding payment, unusual CPU/disk activity during encryption.
* **Trojan:**
    * **Indicators:** Unexpected pop-ups, slow computer performance, unusual network activity (outbound connections to unknown IPs), new or unauthorized programs running in the background, system crashes, altered desktop background.
* **Worm:**
    * **Indicators:** High network bandwidth consumption, unusual network traffic patterns, slow network performance, system crashes, presence of the same malicious file on multiple network hosts, unrequested emails from user accounts.
* **Spyware:**
    * **Indicators:** Excessive pop-up ads, changed browser homepage/search engine, slow browser performance, unexpected toolbars, new icons on desktop, increased network activity, suspicious processes in Task Manager.
* **Bloatware:**
    * **Indicators:** Unwanted pre-installed software consuming system resources, excessive background processes, slow boot-up times, unnecessary notifications, reduced battery life. (Note: While often pre-installed and unwanted, "bloatware" isn't typically considered *malicious* in the same vein as other malware, but it can create performance issues or security vulnerabilities).
* **Virus:**
    * **Indicators:** Files disappearing or becoming corrupted, unexpected program behavior, unusual error messages, slow system performance, frequent crashes, changes to file sizes or modification dates, antivirus warnings.
* **Keylogger:**
    * **Indicators:** Delayed keystrokes, unusual network activity (sending captured data), suspicious files in system directories, antivirus alerts, poor overall system performance. (Difficult to detect without specific tools).
* **Logic bomb:**
    * **Indicators:** Malicious activity occurring at a specific date/time or after a specific event (e.g., employee termination), sudden data deletion, system shutdown, or unauthorized access, often without prior warning signs. (Hard to detect before detonation).
* **Rootkit:**
    * **Indicators:** Antivirus software failing to update or run, inability to apply system updates, suspicious network activity that's not easily attributable, discrepancies in system logs, system crashes with no clear cause, inability to find malicious files. (Designed for stealth, very hard to detect).

### Physical attacks

Indicators related to direct manipulation or interference with physical assets.

* **Brute force:**
    * **Indicators:** Repeated failed login attempts on physical access points (e.g., card readers, keypad entries), unusual sounds from server racks (e.g., fan speed changes), physical damage to locks or doors.
* **Radio frequency identification (RFID) cloning:**
    * **Indicators:** Unauthorized access card usage, duplicate entries in access logs from the same card ID at different times/locations, employees reporting lost/stolen badges that are still being used.
* **Environmental:**
    * **Indicators:** Unexplained temperature spikes in server rooms, water leaks, dust accumulation, power fluctuations, physical damage to infrastructure (e.g., cut cables, tampered climate controls), alarms (fire, smoke, flood) triggering unexpectedly.

### Network attacks

Indicators observed in network traffic or configurations.

* **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS):**
    * **Indicators:** Sudden and significant increase in network traffic, slow or unavailable services, website unresponsiveness, abnormally high CPU/memory utilization on network devices, legitimate users unable to access services.
        * **Amplified:** High outbound bandwidth usage from reflectors (e.g., DNS, NTP, SSDP servers), unusual response sizes to small requests.
        * **Reflected:** High inbound traffic from legitimate but compromised third-party servers.
* **Domain Name System (DNS) attacks:**
    * **Indicators:** Users redirected to incorrect websites, browser security warnings about certificate mismatches, difficulty resolving hostnames, unusual DNS queries or responses in logs, high volume of DNS requests to unknown external servers.
* **Wireless:**
    * **Indicators:** Presence of rogue access points (APs) or evil twins, unauthorized devices connected to the wireless network, weak or changed Wi-Fi passwords, unusual deauthentication frames, unexpected wireless interference.
* **On-path (Man-in-the-Middle - MITM):**
    * **Indicators:** SSL/TLS certificate warnings in browsers, unexpected prompts for credentials, slow network performance, unusual network traffic routing, ARP cache poisoning entries.
* **Credential replay:**
    * **Indicators:** Successful logins from unusual locations or times without corresponding MFA, multiple successful logins for a single account from different IPs in a short period, account usage patterns that deviate from normal.
* **Malicious code (on network devices):**
    * **Indicators:** Router/switch reboots, unexpected configuration changes, unusual network routing, high CPU usage on network devices, unauthorized access attempts to network device management interfaces, unusual traffic flows (e.g., data exfiltration).

### Application attacks

Indicators related to the behavior or output of applications.

* **Injection (SQL, Command, etc.):**
    * **Indicators:** Unexpected database errors in logs, unusual data in database tables, unauthorized access to data, unexpected command execution on server, website defacement, error messages exposing internal application details.
* **Buffer overflow:**
    * **Indicators:** Application crashes or freezes, segmentation faults, unexpected system reboots, abnormal memory usage, strange characters in logs, executable space protection alerts.
* **Replay:**
    * **Indicators:** Repeated successful authentication attempts using old session tokens or credentials, unauthorized transactions occurring identically multiple times, unusual sequences of application events.
* **Privilege escalation:**
    * **Indicators:** A low-privileged user account gaining access to sensitive files or administrative functions, unexpected changes to user permissions, creation of new administrative accounts, unusual commands executed by a standard user.
* **Forgery (CSRF, SSRF):**
    * **Indicators:** Unauthorized actions performed by a legitimate user without their knowledge (e.g., unexpected purchases, password changes, account settings modification), unusual outbound requests from a server (SSRF).
* **Directory traversal:**
    * **Indicators:** Application attempts to access files outside of its designated directory, error messages indicating invalid file paths, access to system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\system32`) via web requests.

### Cryptographic attacks

Indicators of attempts to undermine encryption or hash functions.

* **Downgrade:**
    * **Indicators:** Browser warnings about weak encryption protocols being used (e.g., TLS 1.0 instead of TLS 1.2), explicit negotiation of weaker ciphers in network traffic logs, inability to establish strong encrypted connections.
* **Collision:**
    * **Indicators:** Two different inputs producing the same hash value (highly unlikely in normal operation for secure hashes), suspicious files having identical hash values but different content. (Primarily a theoretical or advanced attack, very hard to detect in practice unless explicitly looking for it).
* **Birthday:**
    * **Indicators:** (Similar to collision) Finding two messages that produce the same hash, potentially leading to forged digital signatures. (Also primarily theoretical/advanced, difficult to detect without specialized analysis).

### Password attacks

Indicators related to attempts to compromise user credentials.

* **Spraying:**
    * **Indicators:** Many different accounts experiencing a small number of failed login attempts for the same password, multiple account lockouts spread across various users, attempts from a single IP address against many usernames.
* **Brute force:**
    * **Indicators:** Repeated failed login attempts for a single account from a specific IP address or a range of IPs, account lockout policies being triggered frequently for specific accounts, high volume of authentication requests in logs.

## General Indicators

These are common signs that can point to malicious activity, regardless of the specific attack type.

* **Account lockout:**
    * **Description:** A user account is automatically locked after too many failed login attempts.
    * **Significance:** Often indicates brute-force or password spraying attacks.
* **Concurrent session usage:**
    * **Description:** The same user account is actively logged in from multiple, geographically disparate locations or different devices simultaneously.
    * **Significance:** Points to a compromised account or shared credentials.
* **Blocked content:**
    * **Description:** Security controls (e.g., firewalls, web filters) block access to known malicious websites, IP addresses, or content.
    * **Significance:** Indicates attempts to access malicious resources, potentially by infected internal systems or users attempting to bypass security.
* **Impossible travel:**
    * **Description:** A user account successfully logs in from two geographically distant locations within an impossibly short timeframe.
    * **Significance:** Strong indicator of a compromised account.
* **Resource consumption:**
    * **Description:** Unexpected spikes in CPU, memory, disk I/O, or network bandwidth usage on a system or network device.
    * **Significance:** Can indicate malware activity, DoS attacks, data exfiltration, or cryptomining.
* **Resource inaccessibility:**
    * **Description:** Users are unable to access network shares, applications, or services that were previously available.
    * **Significance:** Could indicate ransomware, DoS, network segmentation changes, or system compromise.
* **Out-of-cycle logging:**
    * **Description:** Logs show events occurring at unusual times (e.g., high activity during off-hours), or an unusual volume of specific log entries.
    * **Significance:** Indicates suspicious activity when systems should be idle or less active.
* **Published/documented (IOCs):**
    * **Description:** Specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as malicious IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, or email subjects that have been publicly reported by threat intelligence feeds.
    * **Significance:** Allows for proactive detection if an organization's systems communicate with these known malicious entities.
* **Missing logs:**
    * **Description:** Security logs (e.g., event logs, access logs, firewall logs) are missing, incomplete, or show evidence of tampering.
    * **Significance:** A strong indicator that an attacker has gained access and is attempting to cover their tracks.
