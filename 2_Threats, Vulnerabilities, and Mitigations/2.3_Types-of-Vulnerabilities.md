# 2.3 Explain various types of vulnerabilities.

This module details different categories of vulnerabilities, which are weaknesses or flaws in a system, application, or process that could be exploited by a threat actor. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for identifying potential attack vectors and implementing appropriate mitigations.

## Types of Vulnerabilities

### Application

Vulnerabilities found within software applications.

* **Memory injection:**
    * **Description:** An attack where malicious code is injected into the memory of a running application. This can force the application to execute arbitrary code or alter its behavior.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
* **Buffer overflow:**
    * **Description:** Occurs when a program attempts to write more data to a fixed-size memory buffer than it can hold. This overwrites adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to crashes, corrupted data, or execution of malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), arbitrary code execution.
* **Race conditions:**
    * **Description:** A flaw that occurs when the output of a concurrent operation depends on the unpredictable sequence or timing of other events. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the timing of events to gain an advantage.
        * **Time-of-check (TOC):** A vulnerability where the time between when a security control checks a condition (e.g., file permissions) and when the application uses that condition (Time-of-use) allows an attacker to change the condition.
        * **Time-of-use (TOU):** The point at which the checked condition is actually used by the application, which can be different from the time of check.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, bypassing security controls, data corruption.
* **Malicious update:**
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises a legitimate software update mechanism or package, injecting malicious code into what appears to be a trustworthy update.
    * **Impact:** Widespread infection, backdoor installation, system compromise across many users.

### Operating system (OS)-based

* **Description:** Weaknesses found within the core software that manages computer hardware and software resources. This includes unpatched systems, misconfigured services, default settings, or inherent design flaws in the OS.
* **Impact:** System compromise, data theft, DoS, privilege escalation.

### Web-based

Vulnerabilities specific to web applications and services.

* **Structured Query Language injection (SQLi):**
    * **Description:** An attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields on a web application, allowing an attacker to manipulate backend databases.
    * **Impact:** Data theft, data manipulation, database server compromise.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):**
    * **Description:** A type of injection vulnerability where malicious scripts are injected into trusted web sites. When a user visits the compromised site, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or defacing websites.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, malware distribution, identity theft.

### Hardware

Vulnerabilities found in the physical components of a system.

* **Firmware:**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the permanent software programmed into a read-only memory. Exploiting firmware can provide deep system access, often difficult to detect and remove. (e.g., UEFI, BIOS, network device firmware).
    * **Impact:** Persistent compromise, rootkit installation, bypassing OS security.
* **End-of-life (EOL):**
    * **Description:** Hardware that is no longer supported by the manufacturer, meaning it will not receive security updates or patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** Continued exposure to known and undiscovered vulnerabilities, compliance issues.
* **Legacy:**
    * **Description:** Older hardware components that may lack modern security features, have known unpatchable flaws, or are incompatible with current security best practices.
    * **Impact:** Security gaps, compatibility issues with new security tools.

### Virtualization

Vulnerabilities specific to virtualized environments.

* **Virtual machine (VM) escape:**
    * **Description:** An attack where an attacker is able to break out of a guest virtual machine and gain unauthorized access to the host operating system or other virtual machines running on the same host.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the hypervisor and all hosted VMs.
* **Resource reuse:**
    * **Description:** A vulnerability where resources (e.g., memory, disk space) previously used by one virtual machine are not properly purged or reset before being allocated to another VM, potentially allowing data leakage.
    * **Impact:** Data exposure between VMs.

### Cloud-specific

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities unique to cloud computing environments, often stemming from misconfigurations in cloud services, insecure APIs, shared tenancy issues, or improper identity and access management (IAM) within a cloud provider's infrastructure.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized resource access, service disruption, account takeover.

### Supply chain

Vulnerabilities introduced through third-party services, hardware, or software providers.

* **Service provider:**
    * **Description:** A vulnerability in a third-party service (e.g., SaaS, managed security services) that an organization relies on, which can then compromise the relying organization.
* **Hardware provider:**
    * **Description:** Malicious components or design flaws introduced during the manufacturing or distribution of hardware.
* **Software provider:**
    * **Description:** Malicious code injected into legitimate software during development or distribution (e.g., a compromised open-source library, a trojanized software update).
* **Impact:** Widespread compromise, trust erosion, backdoors in essential components.

### Cryptographic

* **Description:** Weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms, protocols, or their implementation that can allow attackers to bypass encryption, decrypt data, or forge digital signatures. This includes using outdated algorithms (e.g., MD5), weak key management, or improper use of cryptographic functions.
* **Impact:** Data confidentiality loss, data integrity compromise, authentication bypass.

### Misconfiguration

* **Description:** Security weaknesses arising from incorrect or insecure settings in software, hardware, or network devices. This is a very common type of vulnerability due to human error, lack of hardening, or default settings left unchanged.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data exposure, DoS.

### Mobile device

Vulnerabilities specific to mobile operating systems and applications.

* **Side loading:**
    * **Description:** Installing applications on a mobile device from sources other than official app stores (e.g., directly from a file), bypassing security checks.
    * **Impact:** Malware infection, exposure to unvetted apps.
* **Jailbreaking (iOS) / Rooting (Android):**
    * **Description:** Modifying a mobile operating system to remove restrictions imposed by the manufacturer, granting the user root access. While it offers more control, it bypasses security layers.
    * **Impact:** Increased susceptibility to malware, loss of security features, voided warranties.

### Zero-day

* **Description:** A previously unknown software vulnerability that developers are not aware of, or for which a patch has not yet been publicly released. Attackers exploit these before defenses can be developed.
* **Impact:** High risk of exploitation as there are no immediate defenses, highly prized by advanced threat actors.
