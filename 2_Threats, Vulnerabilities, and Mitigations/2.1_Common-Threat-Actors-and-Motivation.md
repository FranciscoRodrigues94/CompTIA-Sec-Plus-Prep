# 2.1 Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations.

This module explores the various types of entities that pose a threat to cybersecurity, their defining characteristics, and the reasons behind their malicious activities. Understanding threat actors and their motivations is crucial for anticipating attacks and developing effective defense strategies.

## Threat Actors

Threat actors are individuals or groups that are responsible for an incident, or who have the potential to be responsible for an incident. They can vary widely in their skills, resources, and objectives.

* **Nation-state:**
    * **Description:** Governments sponsoring highly skilled and well-funded groups (often military or intelligence agencies) to achieve national objectives.
    * **Primary Motivations:** Espionage (e.g., stealing state secrets, intellectual property), sabotage (e.g., critical infrastructure disruption), cyber warfare, political influence, and maintaining national superiority.
    * **Characteristics:** Possess advanced capabilities (APT - Advanced Persistent Threat), vast resources, long-term goals, and often operate with plausible deniability.

* **Unskilled attacker (Script Kiddie):**
    * **Description:** Individuals with limited technical knowledge who use pre-made tools or scripts developed by others to launch attacks. They often lack a deep understanding of the underlying vulnerabilities.
    * **Primary Motivations:** Seeking notoriety, curiosity, proving skills (even if borrowed), causing disruption for fun, or simply exploring.
    * **Characteristics:** Low sophistication, rely on publicly available exploits, often cause more noise than significant damage, easily detectable.

* **Hacktivist:**
    * **Description:** Individuals or groups who use hacking techniques to promote a political, social, or ideological cause. Their actions are often aimed at drawing attention to an issue or disrupting organizations they oppose.
    * **Primary Motivations:** Philosophical/political beliefs, social change, protesting perceived injustices, exposing information (doxing), or disrupting operations of target organizations.
    * **Characteristics:** Often target specific organizations or governments, may prioritize impact and publicity over stealth, can range from low to moderate sophistication.

* **Insider threat:**
    * **Description:** A current or former employee, contractor, or business partner who has access to an organization's systems or data and intentionally or unintentionally causes harm.
    * **Primary Motivations:** Revenge, financial gain, espionage (on behalf of another entity), negligence, ideological reasons, or simply error/lack of awareness.
    * **Characteristics:** Possess legitimate access, knowledge of internal systems and processes, making them difficult to detect. Can be malicious or unintentional.

* **Organized crime:**
    * **Description:** Highly structured criminal organizations that use cyber attacks to generate illicit profits. They operate like businesses, often with specialized roles.
    * **Primary Motivations:** Financial gain (e.g., ransomware, credit card fraud, theft of personal data for sale on dark web), extortion, intellectual property theft for profit.
    * **Characteristics:** Professional, well-funded, adaptable, often focus on efficiency and maximizing profit, use sophisticated techniques to evade detection.

* **Shadow IT:**
    * **Description:** Hardware or software used within an organization without the explicit approval or knowledge of the IT department. While not inherently malicious, it introduces significant security risks.
    * **Primary Motivations:** Employees seeking greater efficiency, convenience, or circumventing perceived IT bureaucracy.
    * **Characteristics:** Not malicious in intent, but creates unmanaged vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and potential backdoors due to lack of security controls, patching, or monitoring.

## Attributes of Actors

Understanding the attributes of threat actors helps in assessing the potential risk they pose.

* **Internal/external:**
    * **Internal:** Threat actors operating from within the organization's network or with insider access (e.g., employees, contractors). Often have legitimate access.
    * **External:** Threat actors operating from outside the organization's network (e.g., nation-states, organized crime, hacktivists). Must overcome external defenses.

* **Resources/funding:**
    * **High:** Nation-states, organized crime, large corporate espionage groups often have significant budgets, access to advanced tools, and a large pool of skilled personnel.
    * **Low:** Script kiddies, some individual hacktivists typically rely on free or cheap tools and have limited time/personnel.

* **Level of sophistication/capability:**
    * **High:** Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) sponsored by nation-states, highly skilled organized crime groups use zero-day exploits, custom malware, and advanced evasion techniques.
    * **Medium:** Some hacktivist groups or less organized criminal enterprises might use a mix of off-the-shelf and custom tools, adapting to defenses.
    * **Low:** Script kiddies typically use readily available tools and simple techniques, often relying on known vulnerabilities.

## Motivations

The "why" behind an attack significantly influences the type of attack, its target, and the methods used.

* **Data exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data (e.g., customer information, intellectual property, government secrets) from an organization.
* **Espionage:** Gaining unauthorized access to confidential information, particularly by nation-states or corporate competitors, for strategic advantage.
* **Service disruption:** Causing outages or rendering systems/services unavailable (e.g., Denial-of-Service attacks) often for political statements or as a means of extortion.
* **Blackmail:** Threatening to expose sensitive information or disrupt services unless a ransom is paid.
* **Financial gain:** Direct monetary profit through fraud, theft of financial data, ransomware, or selling stolen information.
* **Philosophical/political beliefs:** Attacking organizations to protest policies, expose perceived wrongdoing, or promote a specific ideology (Hacktivism).
* **Ethical:** Breaking into systems to expose vulnerabilities or unethical practices, often without malicious intent for personal gain (e.g., white-hat hackers, but can also apply to some hacktivist actions).
* **Revenge:** Attacking an organization or individual due to a perceived grievance, often by disgruntled former employees (insider threats).
* **Disruption/chaos:** Causing general disorder, damage, or instability purely for the sake of it, without a clear political or financial motive, or to test capabilities.
* **War:** Using cyber attacks as a component of modern warfare, targeting critical infrastructure, military systems, or propaganda networks to gain strategic advantage or cripple an adversary.
