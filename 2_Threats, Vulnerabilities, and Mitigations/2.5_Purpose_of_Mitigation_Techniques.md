# 2.5 Explain the purpose of mitigation techniques used to secure the enterprise.

This module covers various mitigation techniques, which are strategies and controls implemented to reduce the likelihood or impact of security incidents. These techniques are essential for building a robust and resilient security posture in an enterprise environment.

## Mitigation Techniques

* **Segmentation:**
    * **Purpose:** To divide a network into smaller, isolated segments. This limits the lateral movement of attackers, contains breaches, and allows for more granular control over network traffic. If one segment is compromised, the impact is minimized, and the attack cannot easily spread to other critical areas.
* **Access control:**
    * **Purpose:** To restrict who can access what resources and under what conditions. It ensures that only authorized users or systems can interact with specific data, applications, or network components.
        * **Access control list (ACL):**
            * **Purpose:** A set of rules applied to network devices (like routers, firewalls, switches) or operating systems to filter network traffic or control access to files/folders based on source/destination IP, port, or user identity. Its purpose is to permit or deny specific traffic or resource access.
        * **Permissions:**
            * **Purpose:** Define the specific actions (e.g., read, write, execute, delete) that a user or group is allowed to perform on a resource (e.g., file, folder, database record). Their purpose is to enforce granular control over data manipulation.
* **Application allow list (Whitelisting):**
    * **Purpose:** To prevent the execution of unauthorized software. By only allowing pre-approved applications to run, it significantly reduces the risk of malware, unapproved software, and shadow IT.
* **Isolation:**
    * **Purpose:** To separate a system, application, or network segment from others to prevent a potential compromise from spreading. This can involve sandboxing applications, segmenting networks, or isolating compromised systems for forensics.
* **Patching:**
    * **Purpose:** To apply updates or fixes to software and firmware to correct known vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add new features. Regular patching is critical to close security holes that attackers exploit.
* **Encryption:**
    * **Purpose:** To transform data into an unreadable format to protect its confidentiality. It ensures that even if data is intercepted or stolen, it cannot be understood without the correct decryption key.
* **Monitoring:**
    * **Purpose:** To continuously observe systems, networks, and applications for suspicious activities, security events, and performance anomalies. Effective monitoring helps in early detection of attacks, understanding security posture, and compliance.
* **Least privilege:**
    * **Purpose:** To grant users and systems only the minimum necessary access rights to perform their legitimate functions. This minimizes the potential damage if an account or system is compromised.
* **Configuration enforcement:**
    * **Purpose:** To ensure that systems and devices adhere to predefined secure configurations and policies. This prevents configuration drift and ensures that security baselines are maintained, reducing vulnerabilities caused by misconfigurations.
* **Decommissioning:**
    * **Purpose:** To securely remove systems, applications, or data that are no longer needed. This includes data wiping, physical destruction, and proper disposal to prevent sensitive information from being recovered or systems being exploited after retirement.
* **Hardening techniques:**
    * **Purpose:** To reduce a system's attack surface and strengthen its security by implementing various security measures and configurations.
        * **Encryption (Host-based):**
            * **Purpose:** Encrypting data at rest on individual endpoints (e.g., full disk encryption) to protect data confidentiality even if the physical device is lost or stolen.
        * **Installation of endpoint protection:**
            * **Purpose:** Deploying security software (e.g., antivirus, anti-malware, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)) on individual devices to detect, prevent, and respond to threats at the endpoint level.
        * **Host-based firewall:**
            * **Purpose:** A software firewall running on an individual host (computer or server) to control network traffic entering and leaving that specific device. Its purpose is to provide granular network access control for the host itself.
        * **Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS):**
            * **Purpose:** Software installed on an individual host that monitors system activities (e.g., file changes, registry access, network connections) for malicious behavior and can actively block or prevent suspicious actions.
        * **Disabling ports/protocols:**
            * **Purpose:** To close unnecessary network ports and disable unused communication protocols on systems and devices. This reduces the attack surface by eliminating potential entry points for attackers.
        * **Default password changes:**
            * **Purpose:** To replace the factory-set, often publicly known or easily guessable, default passwords with strong, unique passwords. This prevents attackers from easily gaining access using common credentials.
        * **Removal of unnecessary software:**
            * **Purpose:** To uninstall or disable any software, applications, or services that are not required for the system's function. This reduces the attack surface by eliminating potential vulnerabilities associated with unneeded programs.
