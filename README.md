# CompTIA-Sec-Plus-Prep

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my study notes and practical work dedicated to preparing for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification exam.

Organized by the official exam domains, this repository aims to:

* **Document key concepts:** From threat types and incident response to secure architecture and cryptography.
* **Track learning progress:** Provide a structured approach to covering all exam objectives.

This project not only supports my certification journey but also acts as a public portfolio demonstrating my understanding and practical engagement with cybersecurity fundamentals.
