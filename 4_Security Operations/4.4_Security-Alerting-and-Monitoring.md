## Security Alerting and Monitoring Concepts and Tools

### Monitoring computing resources

The continuous observation and analysis of various IT assets for security-related events and performance.

* **Systems:**
    * **Description:** Monitoring individual operating systems (servers, workstations) for events such as user logins, file access, process execution, service status changes, and system errors.
    * **Purpose:** Detects suspicious activities at the host level, indicating potential compromise, unauthorized access, or malware infection.
* **Applications:**
    * **Description:** Monitoring application-specific logs, performance metrics, and user interactions within software applications.
    * **Purpose:** Identifies application-layer attacks (e.g., SQL injection attempts, unauthorized data access, unusual user behavior within an app) and performance issues that could be security-related.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * **Description:** Monitoring network devices (routers, switches, firewalls), cloud infrastructure components, physical security systems, and environmental controls.
    * **Purpose:** Provides visibility into network traffic patterns, unauthorized network access, firewall policy violations, and physical security breaches.

### Activities

Key processes involved in security monitoring and alerting.

* **Log aggregation:**
    * **Description:** Collecting security logs from various sources (systems, applications, network devices, cloud services) into a centralized location.
    * **Purpose:** Facilitates correlation of events from different sources, simplifies searching and analysis, and ensures logs are preserved for forensics and compliance.
* **Alerting:**
    * **Description:** Generating notifications (e.g., emails, SMS, dashboard alerts) when specific predefined security events or thresholds are met.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures that security teams are immediately informed of potential incidents, enabling rapid response.
* **Scanning:**
    * **Description:** Regularly running automated tools to discover vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or suspicious network activities.
    * **Purpose:** Proactively identifies weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers. (e.g., vulnerability scans, port scans).
* **Reporting:**
    * **Description:** Compiling and presenting monitoring data, alerts, and incident summaries to stakeholders (e.g., security team, management, compliance officers).
    * **Purpose:** Provides insights into the organization's security posture, highlights trends, demonstrates compliance, and supports resource allocation decisions.
* **Archiving:**
    * **Description:** Storing security logs and monitoring data for long-term retention, often for compliance, historical analysis, or future forensic investigations.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures data is available for audits, legal requirements, and post-incident analysis long after real-time processing.
* **Alert response and remediation/validation:**
    * **Description:** The process of reacting to a security alert, investigating its cause, mitigating the identified threat, and confirming that the issue is resolved.
        * **Quarantine:**
            * **Description:** Isolating a compromised or suspicious system/device from the rest of the network to prevent further infection or data exfiltration.
            * **Purpose:** A containment strategy to limit the spread and impact of an incident.
        * **Alert tuning:**
            * **Description:** Adjusting the rules, thresholds, and parameters of monitoring systems to reduce false positives (excessive irrelevant alerts) and false negatives (missing actual threats).
            * **Purpose:** Improves the accuracy and effectiveness of security alerts, reducing alert fatigue and ensuring security teams focus on genuine threats.

### Tools

Various technologies used to facilitate security monitoring and alerting.

* **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP):**
    * **Description:** A suite of open standards that provides a standardized approach for automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation.
    * **Purpose:** Enables interoperability between security tools and automates security configuration auditing and vulnerability checking.
* **Benchmarks:**
    * **Description:** Industry-accepted secure configuration guides or standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).
    * **Purpose:** Provide a baseline for secure configurations against which systems can be measured and monitored for compliance and deviations.
* **Agents/agentless:**
    * **Agents:** Small software programs installed directly on endpoints (servers, workstations) to collect logs, monitor activities, and enforce policies.
    * **Agentless:** Monitoring performed remotely without installing software on the target system, often by querying logs, using SNMP, or network-based scanning.
    * **Purpose:** Choosing between agents (deeper visibility, real-time) and agentless (less overhead, broader coverage) depends on the monitoring needs and environment.
* **Security information and event management (SIEM):**
    * **Description:** A security solution that combines Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM) functions. It aggregates log data, correlates events, and provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.
    * **Purpose:** Provides a centralized platform for security visibility, threat detection, compliance reporting, and incident response support.
* **Antivirus (AV):**
    * **Description:** Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (viruses, malware) from computer systems.
    * **Purpose:** A foundational endpoint protection tool that monitors files and processes for known threats.
* **Data loss prevention (DLP):**
    * **Description:** Systems that detect and prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control, whether through email, cloud storage, USB drives, or other channels.
    * **Purpose:** Monitors, identifies, and protects sensitive data from unauthorized exfiltration or exposure.
* **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps:**
    * **Description:** Alerts generated by network devices (routers, switches, servers) and sent to a central management station when a significant event occurs (e.g., interface status change, high CPU usage).
    * **Purpose:** Provides real-time notifications about network device status and performance, allowing for prompt response to issues that could have security implications.
* **NetFlow:**
    * **Description:** A network protocol developed by Cisco that collects IP traffic information from network devices and sends it to a collector for analysis. It provides metadata about network conversations (who talked to whom, when, how much).
    * **Purpose:** Enables deep analysis of network traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, and helps detect anomalies, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration attempts.
* **Vulnerability scanners:**
    * **Description:** Automated tools that identify security weaknesses in systems and networks by testing them against a database of known vulnerabilities.
    * **Purpose:** Used for proactive identification of vulnerabilities to support vulnerability management programs, as part of continuous monitoring.
