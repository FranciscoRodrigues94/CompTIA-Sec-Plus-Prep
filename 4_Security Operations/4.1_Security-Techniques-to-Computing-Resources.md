## Common Security Techniques to Computing Resources

### Secure baselines

* **Purpose:** A secure baseline is a known, trusted, and documented configuration state for a system or application that meets an organization's security requirements. It serves as a starting point for all new deployments.
    * **Establish:**
        * **Description:** Defining the minimum-security configuration for a system or application. This involves identifying necessary services, applying security settings, removing unnecessary components, and documenting these settings. Often based on industry best practices (e.g., CIS Benchmarks) and organizational policies.
    * **Deploy:**
        * **Description:** Implementing the established baseline across all new systems and applications before they are put into production. This can be automated using tools like configuration management systems or Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
    * **Maintain:**
        * **Description:** Regularly auditing systems against the baseline, monitoring for deviations (configuration drift), and re-applying or updating the baseline as needed due to new threats, patches, or policy changes.
* **Security Implication:** Ensures consistent security configurations across the enterprise, reduces the attack surface by eliminating insecure default settings, and simplifies auditing and compliance.

### Hardening targets

The process of securing a system by reducing its attack surface and mitigating vulnerabilities.

* **Mobile devices:**
    * **Techniques:** Implement strong passcodes/biometrics, enable remote wipe/lock, enforce app store policies, update OS regularly, use MDM, disable unnecessary features (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth when not in use), implement device encryption.
* **Workstations:**
    * **Techniques:** Disable unnecessary services/ports, remove unused software, apply security patches regularly, enforce strong password policies, enable host-based firewalls, implement endpoint protection, restrict user privileges, enable disk encryption.
* **Switches:**
    * **Techniques:** Disable unused ports, implement port security (802.1X), change default credentials, update firmware, disable unnecessary services (e.g., HTTP, Telnet), implement management VLANs, use secure protocols (SSH, HTTPS for management).
* **Routers:**
    * **Techniques:** Change default credentials, update firmware, disable unused ports/services, configure strong firewall rules, implement network address translation (NAT), disable remote management (if not needed), use secure protocols (SSH, SNMPv3 for management).
* **Cloud infrastructure:**
    * **Techniques:** Implement least privilege for IAM roles, configure security groups/network ACLs, encrypt data at rest and in transit, use security best practices from the cloud provider (e.g., AWS CIS Benchmarks), enable logging and monitoring, secure APIs, manage shared responsibility model.
* **Servers:**
    * **Techniques:** Follow secure baseline configurations, remove unnecessary roles/features, apply security patches, implement host-based firewall, use strong authentication, enable auditing/logging, secure remote access (SSH with key-based auth), disable unnecessary user accounts.
* **ICS/SCADA:**
    * **Techniques:** Air-gapping (if possible), strict network segmentation (DMZs), use of unidirectional gateways (data diodes), implement jump servers, limit direct internet access, strong physical security, vendor-specific patching, robust monitoring for anomalous behavior.
* **Embedded systems:**
    * **Techniques:** Change default credentials, disable unused interfaces/ports, update firmware (if possible), physical tamper detection, secure boot mechanisms, ensure code integrity, use hardware-based security features (e.g., secure elements). Often have limited resources, making hardening challenging.
* **RTOS (Real-time operating systems):**
    * **Techniques:** Minimize attack surface (only essential components), use secure coding practices, ensure data integrity, limit external connectivity, apply strict access controls. Patching can be very difficult due to real-time constraints.
* **IoT devices:**
    * **Techniques:** Change default credentials immediately, isolate devices on separate networks, use strong encryption for communication, regularly check for firmware updates, disable cloud connectivity if not essential, use secure provisioning.

### Wireless devices

* **Installation considerations:**
    * **Site surveys:**
        * **Description:** A process of planning and designing a wireless network to provide the desired level of coverage, capacity, and performance.
        * **Security Implication:** Helps identify potential sources of interference, optimal placement for APs to minimize signal leakage outside the intended area, and detect rogue access points. Essential for ensuring strong signal strength only where needed and preventing eavesdropping.
    * **Heat maps:**
        * **Description:** Visual representations of wireless signal strength and coverage across a physical area, generated from site survey data.
        * **Security Implication:** Used to identify areas with weak signal (potential dead spots, making it hard to connect) or strong signal where it shouldn't be (signal spill, potential for unauthorized access from outside the premises). Helps optimize AP placement for secure coverage.

### Mobile solutions

Strategies for managing and securing mobile devices in an enterprise.

* **Mobile device management (MDM):**
    * **Description:** Software that allows IT administrators to remotely manage, configure, and secure mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) used within an organization.
    * **Security Implication:** Enforces security policies (e.g., password complexity, encryption), manages app installation, performs remote wipes/locks, and tracks devices, centralizing control over diverse mobile endpoints.
* **Deployment models:**
    * **Bring your own device (BYOD):**
        * **Description:** Employees use their personal mobile devices for work purposes.
        * **Security Implication:** Lower cost for organization, but higher security risk due to mixed personal/work data, lack of full control over device security, and potential for data leakage. Requires strict policies and MDM/MAM.
    * **Corporate-owned, personally enabled (COPE):**
        * **Description:** Organization provides devices to employees, but allows limited personal use.
        * **Security Implication:** Higher control for IT over device security, but still requires balancing security with user privacy. Data separation (e.g., via containers) is common.
    * **Choose your own device (CYOD):**
        * **Description:** Employees choose from a list of pre-approved, corporate-owned devices.
        * **Security Implication:** Provides a balance of control and employee choice. Devices are corporate assets, allowing IT to enforce full security policies and configurations, while users have some flexibility in device model.
* **Connection methods:**
    * **Cellular:**
        * **Security Implication:** Generally secure due to carrier-controlled encryption, but vulnerable to SIM swapping, Stingray/IMSI catchers, or insecure applications using cellular data.
    * **Wi-Fi:**
        * **Security Implication:** Most common. Vulnerable to weak encryption, rogue APs, unsecure public Wi-Fi. Requires strong Wi-Fi security (WPA3), VPNs, and secure network configurations.
    * **Bluetooth:**
        * **Security Implication:** Short-range, but vulnerable to eavesdropping, unauthorized access (Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing), and device pairing exploits if not properly configured or if discoverable mode is always on.

### Wireless security settings

* **Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3):**
    * **Purpose:** The latest security standard for wireless networks, providing stronger encryption (192-bit cryptographic strength), improved individual data encryption with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) even on open networks, and enhanced protection against dictionary attacks.
* **AAA/Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS):**
    * **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting):** A framework for controlling access to network resources and tracking user activity.
    * **RADIUS:** A networking protocol that provides centralized AAA management for users and devices connecting to a network (e.g., Wi-Fi, VPN).
    * **Purpose:** Provides robust centralized authentication for wireless users (e.g., EAP-TLS with RADIUS), allowing administrators to manage user access, enforce policies, and log activity from a central server.
* **Cryptographic protocols:**
    * **Purpose:** Implement strong encryption standards (e.g., AES) for data transmitted over wireless networks to ensure confidentiality and integrity, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.
* **Authentication protocols:**
    * **Purpose:** Define how users or devices prove their identity to access the wireless network (e.g., EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-TTLS). Strong protocols prevent unauthorized access and protect against credential theft.

### Application security

Techniques applied during development and deployment to secure applications.

* **Input validation:**
    * **Purpose:** The process of ensuring that data entered by a user or an external system into an application conforms to expected formats and ranges before it is processed.
    * **Security Implication:** Crucial for preventing common attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows by sanitizing or rejecting malicious input.
* **Secure cookies:**
    * **Purpose:** Implementing attributes for HTTP cookies (e.g., `Secure` flag, `HttpOnly` flag, `SameSite` attribute) to protect their confidentiality and integrity.
    * **Security Implication:** Prevents cookies from being transmitted over unencrypted connections, accessed by client-side scripts (preventing XSS session hijacking), or sent cross-site inappropriately (CSRF protection).
* **Static code analysis (SAST - Static Application Security Testing):**
    * **Purpose:** Analyzing application source code, bytecode, or binary code without executing it, to identify potential security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and adherence to coding standards.
    * **Security Implication:** Finds vulnerabilities early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), making them cheaper and easier to fix.
* **Code signing:**
    * **Purpose:** Using digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of software code. It confirms who published the software and that the code has not been tampered with since it was signed.
    * **Security Implication:** Helps users verify the trustworthiness of software before execution, protecting against malicious or altered code.

### Sandboxing

* **Purpose:** Running an application or process in an isolated environment (sandbox) where it has limited access to system resources.
* **Security Implication:** Contains potential threats by preventing malicious code from affecting the rest of the system or network. If the sandboxed application is compromised, the damage is confined.

### Monitoring

* **Purpose:** Continuously observing the state, performance, and security of computing resources, systems, and applications.
* **Security Implication:** Provides real-time visibility into security events, helps detect anomalies that could indicate an attack, and is essential for incident response and forensic analysis. Includes logging, alerting, and traffic analysis.
