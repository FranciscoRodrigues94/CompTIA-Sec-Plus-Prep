# 4.6 Given a scenario, implement and maintain identity and access management

This module delves into Identity and Access Management (IAM), a critical security discipline that ensures the right individuals and entities have the right access to the right resources at the right time, for the right reasons. Proper IAM implementation is fundamental to protecting an organization's assets and maintaining compliance.

## Implementing and Maintaining Identity and Access Management

### Provisioning/de-provisioning user accounts

* **Provisioning:**
    * **Description:** The process of creating, updating, and managing user accounts and their associated permissions across various systems and applications. This includes setting up new employees with necessary access.
    * **Security Implication:** Ensures users have access to required resources promptly. If not managed properly, can lead to over-privileging.
* **De-provisioning:**
    * **Description:** The process of revoking or removing user access from systems and applications when a user leaves the organization or no longer requires access.
    * **Security Implication:** Prevents unauthorized access by former employees or compromised accounts. Timely de-provisioning is crucial to mitigate insider threats and credential compromise risks.

### Permission assignments and implications

* **Description:** Granting specific rights or privileges to users or groups, defining what actions they can perform on resources (e.g., read, write, execute, delete).
* **Security Implications:** Improper permission assignments (e.g., granting excessive privileges) are a leading cause of data breaches and internal threats. Adhering to the principle of least privilege is paramount.

### Identity proofing

* **Description:** The process of verifying that an individual is who they claim to be, typically during account creation or when high-trust actions are required. This can involve document verification, biometric checks, or knowledge-based questions.
* **Security Implication:** Prevents fraudulent account creation and ensures that user identities are legitimate, strengthening the overall security of access management.

### Federation

* **Description:** A system that allows a user's identity to be established in one domain (the identity provider) and then securely used to access resources in other, separate domains (service providers) without re-authenticating.
* **Security Implication:** Simplifies access for users and reduces administrative overhead. However, compromise of the identity provider can affect all federated services. Requires strong trust relationships and secure token exchange.

### Single sign-on (SSO)

* **Description:** An authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to gain access to multiple related, yet independent, software systems.
    * **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP):**
        * **Description:** An application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services. Commonly used for authenticating users against a directory like Active Directory.
        * **Security Implication:** Provides a centralized authentication mechanism, but securing the LDAP server and communication (e.g., LDAP over SSL/TLS) is critical.
    * **Open authorization (OAuth):**
        * **Description:** An open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites without giving them the passwords. It's about authorization, not authentication.
        * **Security Implication:** Facilitates secure third-party application integration but requires careful scope management and secure token handling.
    * **Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML):**
        * **Description:** An XML-based open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider. Often used for web-based SSO between organizations.
        * **Security Implication:** Enables seamless, secure SSO across different domains but relies on the security of the SAML assertions and digital signatures.
* **Security Implication of SSO:** Enhances user convenience and reduces password fatigue, which can lead to better password practices. Centralizes authentication point, making it a high-value target for attackers if compromised.

### Interoperability

* **Description:** The ability of different systems, applications, or components to work together seamlessly and exchange information effectively.
* **Security Implication:** In IAM, interoperability ensures that identity and access data can be consistently shared and managed across diverse IT environments, preventing security gaps that arise from incompatible systems.

### Attestation

* **Description:** The process of verifying that a system or component meets certain security criteria or is in a specific, expected state. In IAM, it can refer to periodic verification of user access rights.
* **Security Implication:** Ensures ongoing compliance with security policies and regulations by regularly confirming that access permissions remain appropriate and have not drifted.

### Access controls

Mechanisms that determine who can access what resources and under what conditions.

* **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):**
    * **Description:** Access decisions are based on security labels (sensitivity levels) assigned to subjects (users/processes) and objects (files/resources). The OS or system enforces the policy, and users cannot override it.
    * **Security Implication:** Provides the highest level of security and is used in highly secure environments (e.g., military, government) where information classification is paramount.
* **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):**
    * **Description:** The owner of a resource (or a subject with appropriate permissions) can grant or deny access to other subjects.
    * **Security Implication:** Common in most commercial operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux). Provides flexibility but can be less secure if users make poor access decisions or over-privilege.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * **Description:** Access permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles. Users inherit the permissions of the roles they are assigned to.
    * **Security Implication:** Simplifies management of large user bases, reduces errors, and facilitates adherence to least privilege by standardizing access based on job functions.
* **Rule-Based Access Control:**
    * **Description:** Access is granted or denied based on a set of predefined rules or conditions (e.g., firewall rules, "if this, then that").
    * **Security Implication:** Provides highly granular and automated control over access, useful for dynamic environments.
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
    * **Description:** Access decisions are based on a set of attributes associated with the user (subject), the resource (object), the environment, and the action being requested.
    * **Security Implication:** Offers the most flexible and fine-grained access control, adapting to complex scenarios and providing dynamic authorization.
* **Time-of-day restrictions:**
    * **Description:** Limiting user access to systems or resources only during specific hours or days (e.g., only during business hours).
    * **Security Implication:** Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers or malicious insiders, especially for critical systems outside of normal operational hours.
* **Least privilege:**
    * **Description:** Users should be granted only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their job functions and no more.
    * **Security Implication:** Minimizes the potential damage caused by compromised accounts or malicious insiders, as attackers gain limited access if a low-privileged account is compromised.

### Multifactor authentication (MFA)

* **Description:** An authentication method that requires a user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource.
    * **Implementations:**
        * **Biometrics:**
            * **Description:** Verification based on unique biological or behavioral characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan, voice print).
            * **Security Implication:** Hard to fake or steal, but can have false positives/negatives, and physical compromise (e.g., severed finger) is a theoretical risk.
        * **Hard/soft authentication tokens:**
            * **Hard tokens:** Physical devices that generate one-time passwords (OTP) or respond to challenges (e.g., RSA SecurID, YubiKey).
            * **Soft tokens:** Software-based OTP generators on mobile devices (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).
            * **Security Implication:** Provide a "something you have" factor, making it much harder for an attacker to gain access even if they steal a password. Hard tokens are generally more secure against malware.
        * **Security keys:**
            * **Description:** Physical devices (e.g., FIDO U2F/WebAuthn keys) that use public-key cryptography for strong authentication.
            * **Security Implication:** Highly resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks because the authentication is cryptographically bound to the site.
    * **Factors:**
        * **Something you know:** (e.g., password, PIN, security questions)
        * **Something you have:** (e.g., OTP token, smartphone, smart card, security key)
        * **Something you are:** (e.g., fingerprint, face scan, voice print - biometrics)
        * **Somewhere you are:** (e.g., geolocation, IP address range)
* **Security Implication of MFA:** Significantly increases security by requiring multiple independent pieces of evidence for identity verification, making it much harder for attackers to compromise accounts even if one factor is stolen.

### Password concepts

* **Password best practices:**
    * **Length:** Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
    * **Complexity:** Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Reuse:** Never reuse passwords across different accounts.
    * **Expiration:** Require users to change passwords periodically (though modern thinking emphasizes length/complexity over frequent forced changes).
    * **Age:** Minimum and maximum age requirements for passwords.
* **Security Implication:** Good password practices are the first line of defense against unauthorized access through brute-force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.
* **Password managers:**
    * **Description:** Applications that securely store and manage unique, complex passwords for multiple accounts, often generating them automatically.
    * **Security Implication:** Encourages and enables users to follow best practices (length, complexity, non-reuse) without memorizing many passwords, greatly improving overall password security.
* **Passwordless:**
    * **Description:** Authentication methods that eliminate the need for traditional passwords, relying instead on other factors like biometrics, FIDO2 security keys, or magic links.
    * **Security Implication:** Eliminates entire classes of password-related attacks (phishing, brute-force, credential stuffing), significantly improving security and user experience.

### Privileged access management (PAM) tools

* **Description:** Solutions designed to manage and secure accounts with elevated permissions (e.g., administrator, root, service accounts), which are often primary targets for attackers.
    * **Just-in-time permissions:**
        * **Description:** Granting elevated privileges only for a specific, limited period when they are absolutely needed, and revoking them immediately afterward.
        * **Security Implication:** Minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit privileged accounts. Enforces the principle of "least privilege, just enough time."
    * **Password vaulting:**
        * **Description:** Securely storing and managing privileged account credentials (passwords, SSH keys) in an encrypted vault, often with automated rotation and controlled access.
        * **Security Implication:** Prevents human administrators from directly knowing privileged passwords, reducing the risk of theft or misuse.
    * **Ephemeral credentials:**
        * **Description:** Short-lived, temporary credentials that expire automatically after a set period or single use.
        * **Security Implication:** Reduces the risk associated with compromised credentials because their validity window is extremely short, making them less valuable to an attacker.
