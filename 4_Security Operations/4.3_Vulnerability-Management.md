## Activities Associated with Vulnerability Management

### Identification methods

Techniques used to discover vulnerabilities within an organization's systems, applications, and networks.

* **Vulnerability scan:**
    * **Description:** An automated process of identifying known security weaknesses in systems, applications, and networks by comparing them against a database of known vulnerabilities.
    * **Purpose:** Provides a broad overview of vulnerabilities across the IT landscape, helps prioritize patching, and ensures compliance with security policies.
* **Application security:**
    * **Static analysis (SAST - Static Application Security Testing):**
        * **Description:** Analyzing application source code, bytecode, or binary code without executing it, to find security flaws like SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, etc.
        * **Purpose:** Identifies vulnerabilities early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), making them cheaper and easier to fix.
    * **Dynamic analysis (DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing):**
        * **Description:** Testing an application in its running state (e.g., a deployed web application) by simulating attacks from the outside, looking for runtime vulnerabilities.
        * **Purpose:** Detects runtime issues, configuration errors, and vulnerabilities that might not be visible in static code (e.g., authentication flaws, session management issues).
    * **Package monitoring:**
        * **Description:** Scanning and monitoring third-party libraries, open-source components, and software packages used within applications for known vulnerabilities.
        * **Purpose:** Addresses the significant risk posed by vulnerabilities in dependencies, which are often overlooked but widely used.
* **Threat feed:**
    * **Description:** Real-time streams of information about current and emerging cyber threats, including Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), vulnerabilities, and attack methodologies.
    * **Open-source intelligence (OSINT):**
        * **Description:** Threat intelligence gathered from publicly available sources (e.g., public databases, forums, news articles, social media).
        * **Purpose:** Provides broad insights into general threat landscape and attacker tactics.
    * **Proprietary/third-party:**
        * **Description:** Threat intelligence provided by commercial vendors or specialized security firms, often more detailed and curated.
        * **Purpose:** Offers specific, actionable intelligence tailored to common threats and industry sectors.
    * **Information-sharing organization:**
        * **Description:** Groups (e.g., ISACs - Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) where organizations share threat intelligence and best practices within a specific industry.
        * **Purpose:** Enables collaborative defense, allowing members to learn from and protect against threats targeting their sector.
    * **Dark web:**
        * **Description:** Information gathered from hidden parts of the internet where illicit activities and data trading often occur.
        * **Purpose:** Provides insights into stolen credentials, zero-day exploits, and planned attacks targeting specific organizations or industries.
* **Penetration testing:**
    * **Description:** A simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or web application to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It goes beyond scanning to actively attempt to exploit weaknesses.
    * **Purpose:** Provides a realistic assessment of an organization's security posture from an attacker's perspective, identifies complex vulnerabilities that automated scanners might miss, and validates existing security controls.
* **Responsible disclosure program:**
    * **Description:** A policy that encourages security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to the vendor or organization, allowing them time to fix the issue before public disclosure.
    * **Bug bounty program:**
        * **Description:** A specific type of responsible disclosure program that offers financial rewards to security researchers for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities.
        * **Purpose:** Leverages the global community of ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, effectively extending the organization's security team.
* **System/process audit:**
    * **Description:** A formal review of an organization's systems, processes, and policies to assess compliance with security standards, regulations, and best practices.
    * **Purpose:** Identifies gaps in controls, policy non-compliance, and operational inefficiencies that could lead to vulnerabilities.

### Analysis

Evaluating identified vulnerabilities to understand their risk and impact.

* **Confirmation:**
    * **Description:** Verifying that a reported vulnerability is real and not a false alarm.
        * **False positive:**
            * **Description:** A security tool or method incorrectly identifies something as malicious or a vulnerability when it is not (e.g., a scanner flags a legitimate file as malware).
            * **Security Implication:** Wastes time and resources investigating non-existent threats.
        * **False negative:**
            * **Description:** A security tool or method fails to identify an actual malicious activity or vulnerability (e.g., an IDS misses an attack, a scanner misses a vulnerability).
            * **Security Implication:** The most dangerous, as it leaves an organization exposed to actual threats without awareness.
* **Prioritize:**
    * **Description:** Ranking vulnerabilities based on their severity, exploitability, potential impact, and business criticality.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed first, optimizing resource allocation for remediation efforts.
* **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):**
    * **Description:** An open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities. It provides a numerical score (0-10) indicating severity.
    * **Purpose:** Offers a standardized way to rate vulnerability severity, facilitating consistent prioritization across organizations and systems.
* **Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE):**
    * **Description:** A list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, each assigned a unique identifier (CVE ID).
    * **Purpose:** Provides a common dictionary for known vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to easily share information and correlate findings from different security tools.
* **Vulnerability classification:**
    * **Description:** Categorizing vulnerabilities based on their type (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, misconfiguration) or the affected component.
    * **Purpose:** Helps understand the root causes of vulnerabilities and develop targeted remediation strategies or preventative measures.
* **Exposure factor:**
    * **Description:** The percentage of an asset's value that is lost if a specific threat exploits a specific vulnerability.
    * **Purpose:** Quantifies the potential loss, aiding in risk assessment and prioritization.
* **Environmental variables:**
    * **Description:** Factors within an organization's specific operating environment that influence the actual risk posed by a vulnerability (e.g., presence of compensating controls, network segmentation, public exposure).
    * **Purpose:** Allows for a more accurate, contextual risk assessment beyond a generic CVSS score.
* **Industry/organizational impact:**
    * **Description:** The potential effects of an exploited vulnerability on the organization's business operations, reputation, legal standing, and compliance.
    * **Purpose:** Crucial for prioritizing vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat to critical business functions or regulatory obligations.
* **Risk tolerance:**
    * **Description:** The level of risk that an organization is willing to accept.
    * **Purpose:** Guides decisions on which vulnerabilities to remediate immediately, which to accept, and which to mitigate with compensating controls.

### Vulnerability response and remediation

Actions taken to address and fix identified vulnerabilities.

* **Patching:**
    * **Description:** Applying software updates or fixes released by vendors to correct known vulnerabilities.
    * **Purpose:** The most common and direct method to eliminate vulnerabilities.
* **Insurance:**
    * **Description:** Cyber liability insurance policies that provide financial coverage for losses incurred due to cyber incidents.
    * **Purpose:** A risk transference strategy that helps mitigate the financial impact of a breach, but does not prevent the vulnerability or attack itself.
* **Segmentation:**
    * **Description:** Isolating vulnerable systems or networks into separate segments to limit the potential spread of an attack if the vulnerability is exploited.
    * **Purpose:** A compensating control that reduces the blast radius of an exploit, buying time for remediation.
* **Compensating controls:**
    * **Description:** Alternative security controls implemented to provide equivalent protection when a primary control is not feasible or effective (e.g., using an IPS to virtually patch a known vulnerability on a system that cannot be patched directly).
    * **Purpose:** Provides interim protection for vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately remediated.
* **Exceptions and exemptions:**
    * **Description:** Formal processes for documenting and approving situations where a specific vulnerability will not be remediated immediately, or a security policy will not be fully adhered to, often due to business criticality, technical impossibility, or high cost.
    * **Purpose:** Manages risk formally, ensures stakeholders are aware of residual risk, and typically requires additional compensating controls and a review period.

### Validation of remediation

Verifying that vulnerabilities have been effectively fixed.

* **Rescanning:**
    * **Description:** Rerunning vulnerability scans on systems after remediation efforts to confirm that the identified vulnerabilities are no longer present.
    * **Purpose:** The primary method to confirm successful patching or configuration changes.
* **Audit:**
    * **Description:** A formal review of the remediation process, documentation, and system configurations to ensure compliance with policies and effective resolution.
    * **Purpose:** Provides assurance to management and auditors that the vulnerability management process is effective and rigorously followed.
* **Verification:**
    * **Description:** A broader term for confirming that a vulnerability has been addressed, which might include manual checks, penetration testing re-tests, or code reviews, in addition to rescanning.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures that fixes are complete, don't introduce new issues, and effectively mitigate the original risk.

### Reporting

* **Purpose:** Communicating the status of vulnerabilities, remediation progress, and overall risk posture to relevant stakeholders (e.g., management, IT teams, compliance officers).
* **Security Implication:** Essential for informed decision-making, resource allocation, demonstrating due diligence, and maintaining awareness of the organization's security health. Reports typically include vulnerability trends, remediation rates, and risk metrics.
