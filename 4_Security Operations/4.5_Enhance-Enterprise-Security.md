## Modifying Enterprise Capabilities to Enhance Security

### Firewall

A network security device or software that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

* **Rules:**
    * **Description:** Specific instructions that dictate whether to permit or deny traffic based on criteria like source/destination IP, port, protocol.
    * **Enhancement:** Implementing granular rules (e.g., denying all by default and only explicitly allowing necessary traffic), regularly reviewing and optimizing rulesets to remove redundancies or allow unintended access.
* **Access lists (ACLs):**
    * **Description:** Lists of rules that control network traffic and can be applied to various network devices like routers and switches, often used to filter traffic based on source/destination address or port number.
    * **Enhancement:** Creating strict ACLs to segment networks, restrict communication between sensitive areas, and control administrative access to network devices.
* **Ports/protocols:**
    * **Description:** Network communication endpoints and the methods of communication used.
    * **Enhancement:** Closing unnecessary ports, disabling unused protocols, and restricting allowed ports/protocols to only those essential for business operations reduces the attack surface significantly.
* **Screened subnets (DMZ):**
    * **Description:** A sub-network that acts as a buffer zone between an organization's internal network and an untrusted network (e.g., the internet), secured by multiple firewalls.
    * **Enhancement:** Properly configuring the DMZ allows public-facing services (web servers, email servers) to be accessed from the internet while isolating them from the internal network, protecting internal assets if DMZ servers are compromised.

### IDS/IPS

Systems that detect or prevent malicious network activity.

* **Trends:**
    * **Description:** Patterns or changes in network traffic or attack methods observed over time.
    * **Enhancement:** Analyzing trends in IDS/IPS alerts (e.g., increase in specific attack types, source IPs) helps adapt defenses, fine-tune rules, and anticipate future threats.
* **Signatures:**
    * **Description:** Specific patterns or characteristics of known attacks, malware, or vulnerabilities that IDS/IPS systems use for detection.
    * **Enhancement:** Regularly updating IDS/IPS signatures ensures detection of the latest known threats. Customizing signatures for organization-specific assets or anticipated attacks provides tailored protection.

### Web filter

A security solution that controls access to websites based on content, categories, or reputation.

* **Agent-based:**
    * **Description:** Software agents installed on endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops) to enforce web filtering policies regardless of network location.
    * **Enhancement:** Provides consistent web security for mobile and remote users.
* **Centralized proxy:**
    * **Description:** All web traffic is routed through a central proxy server that applies filtering policies before forwarding requests to the internet.
    * **Enhancement:** Offers centralized management, content inspection, caching, and anonymization for all internal users, simplifying policy enforcement.
* **Universal Resource Locator (URL) scanning:**
    * **Description:** Inspecting the full URL of a requested website against blacklists, whitelists, or threat intelligence.
    * **Enhancement:** Blocks access to known malicious or inappropriate websites.
* **Content categorization:**
    * **Description:** Classifying websites into categories (e.g., social media, news, gambling, malware) to apply granular access policies.
    * **Enhancement:** Allows organizations to block or limit access to specific categories based on productivity or security needs.
* **Block rules:**
    * **Description:** Explicit rules that prevent access to specific websites, domains, or IP addresses.
    * **Enhancement:** Directly prevents access to known malicious sites or those violating policy.
* **Reputation:**
    * **Description:** Assessing the trustworthiness and security history of a website or domain.
    * **Enhancement:** Blocking access to websites with poor security reputations (e.g., known for hosting malware, phishing) prevents users from visiting dangerous sites.

### Operating system security

Securing the core software that manages computer hardware and software resources.

* **Group Policy (GPO):**
    * **Description:** A feature in Microsoft Windows environments that provides centralized management and configuration of operating systems, applications, and users' settings in an Active Directory environment.
    * **Enhancement:** Enforces security policies across all domain-joined machines (e.g., password policies, software restrictions, firewall rules, USB device control), ensuring consistent hardening.
* **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux):**
    * **Description:** A mandatory access control (MAC) security module for the Linux kernel that provides mechanisms for supporting security policies, including access controls.
    * **Enhancement:** Provides fine-grained control over what processes can access, even if they are running as root. This significantly limits the damage an attacker can do even if they gain control of a service.

### Implementation of secure protocols

Ensuring data communication is protected.

* **Protocol selection:**
    * **Description:** Choosing cryptographic protocols and standards for communication.
    * **Enhancement:** Preferring secure alternatives over insecure ones (e.g., SSH over Telnet, SFTP over FTP, HTTPS over HTTP, SNMPv3 over SNMPv1/v2c).
* **Port selection:**
    * **Description:** Using non-standard or alternative ports for services to make them less discoverable by automated scanners.
    * **Enhancement:** While not a primary security control, it can deter basic reconnaissance attempts and reduce noise from script kiddies.
* **Transport method:**
    * **Description:** The underlying method used to carry data across a network.
    * **Enhancement:** Utilizing encrypted transport methods (e.g., VPNs, TLS tunnels) for all sensitive data in transit, regardless of the application protocol.

### DNS filtering

* **Purpose:** To block access to malicious or unwanted websites by resolving domain names through a DNS server that filters requests based on threat intelligence or content categories.
* **Enhancement:** Prevents users from accessing known phishing sites, malware command-and-control servers, or inappropriate content at the DNS resolution level, adding an early layer of defense.

### Email security

Protecting email communications from threats.

* **Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC):**
    * **Description:** An email authentication protocol that builds on SPF and DKIM to allow email senders to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells receivers what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes (e.g., quarantine, reject). It also provides reporting.
    * **Enhancement:** Prevents email spoofing and phishing attacks by ensuring that emails claiming to be from a specific domain are legitimately sent by that domain.
* **DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):**
    * **Description:** An email authentication method that uses a digital signature to verify the sender of an email and ensure that the email content has not been tampered with in transit.
    * **Enhancement:** Adds integrity and authentication to email, making it harder for attackers to impersonate senders or modify messages.
* **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):**
    * **Description:** An email authentication method that allows email senders to specify which IP addresses are authorized to send email on behalf of their domain.
    * **Enhancement:** Helps prevent email spoofing by allowing recipient servers to check if an incoming email from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.
* **Gateway:**
    * **Description:** An email security gateway is a device or software that filters incoming and outgoing email traffic, inspecting for spam, malware, phishing, and sensitive content.
    * **Enhancement:** Provides a centralized point of enforcement for email security policies, offering protection against various email-borne threats before they reach user inboxes.

### File integrity monitoring (FIM)

* **Purpose:** To detect unauthorized or malicious changes to critical operating system files, application files, and configuration files by comparing their current state to a known good baseline.
* **Enhancement:** Provides early warning of potential tampering, rootkits, or malware infections that modify system files, crucial for detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Data loss prevention (DLP)

* **Purpose:** To prevent sensitive information from leaving the organization's controlled environment through various channels (e.g., email, cloud uploads, USB drives, printing) by monitoring, detecting, and blocking unauthorized transfers.
* **Enhancement:** Protects against accidental or malicious data exfiltration, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.

### Network access control (NAC)

* **Purpose:** A security solution that restricts access to the network for devices that do not meet specific security requirements (e.g., updated antivirus, current OS patches). It can also authenticate users and assign them to specific network segments.
* **Enhancement:** Ensures that only healthy and authorized devices and users can connect to the network, enforcing security policies at the point of access.

### Endpoint detection and response (EDR)/extended detection and response (XDR)

* **EDR:**
    * **Description:** Security solutions that continuously monitor and collect data from endpoint devices (laptops, desktops, servers), providing advanced threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities.
    * **Enhancement:** Goes beyond traditional antivirus by offering deeper visibility into endpoint activities, enabling detection of fileless malware, advanced persistent threats, and rapid incident response.
* **XDR:**
    * **Description:** Builds upon EDR by integrating and correlating security data from multiple security layers beyond just endpoints, including network, cloud, identity, and email.
    * **Enhancement:** Provides a broader, unified view of an attack across the entire IT ecosystem, improving detection accuracy, accelerating investigations, and enabling more effective responses.

### User behavior analytics (UBA)

* **Purpose:** To detect anomalous or suspicious user activities by analyzing patterns of user behavior. It establishes a baseline of normal behavior and flags deviations.
* **Enhancement:** Identifies insider threats, compromised accounts, and malicious activities that might bypass traditional signature-based security controls by focusing on behavioral anomalies (e.g., unusual login times, access to sensitive data outside normal patterns, excessive data downloads).
