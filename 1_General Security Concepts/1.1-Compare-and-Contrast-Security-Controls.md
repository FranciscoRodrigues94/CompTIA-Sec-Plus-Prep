# 1.1 Compare and Contrast Various Types of Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to physical property, information, computer systems, or other assets. Understanding their types and categories is fundamental in cybersecurity.

## Categories of Security Controls

Security controls can be broadly categorized by their primary function or the nature of their implementation.

### 1. Technical Controls

* **Definition:** Controls implemented through technology, software, or hardware. They enforce security policies and provide protection directly within IT systems.
* **Purpose:** To protect systems and data by limiting access, enforcing authentication, and preventing unauthorized actions.
* **Examples:**
    * **Firewalls:** Restrict network traffic based on predefined rules.
    * **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) / Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Monitor network or system activities for malicious or policy-violating activity.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Define permissions for users or groups on specific resources.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource.
    * **Antivirus/Anti-malware software:** Detects and removes malicious software.
    * **Encryption:** Converts information into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:** Collect and analyze security logs from various sources.

### 2. Managerial (Administrative) Controls

* **Definition:** Controls implemented through policies, procedures, guidelines, and administrative practices. They define the security framework of an organization.
* **Purpose:** To guide human behavior and decision-making regarding security.
* **Examples:**
    * **Security Policies:** Formal documents outlining rules for safeguarding information (e.g., Acceptable Use Policy, Password Policy).
    * **Risk Assessments:** Processes to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential security risks.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Educating employees about security threats and best practices.
    * **Background Checks:** Screening potential employees to assess security risks.
    * **Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) / Business Continuity Plans (BCP):** Documents outlining procedures for recovering from disasters and maintaining business operations.
    * **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Detailed, written instructions on how to perform routine security tasks.

### 3. Operational Controls

* **Definition:** Controls implemented and executed by people, often on a day-to-day basis, to maintain the security posture defined by managerial policies and enabled by technical controls.
* **Purpose:** To ensure the proper execution of security policies and procedures.
* **Examples:**
    * **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly scanning systems for weaknesses and patching them.
    * **Incident Response Procedures:** Steps taken when a security incident occurs (e.g., containment, eradication, recovery).
    * **Security Monitoring:** Continuous observation of systems and networks for suspicious activity.
    * **Backup and Recovery:** Regular creation of data copies and processes to restore them.
    * **Physical Security Operations:** Activities performed by security guards, patrolling, reviewing surveillance footage.
    * **Environmental Controls:** Managing HVAC, fire suppression systems.

### 4. Physical Controls

* **Definition:** Controls that protect physical assets, environments, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, damage, or theft.
* **Purpose:** To restrict physical access to sensitive areas and protect hardware.
* **Examples:**
    * **Fencing, Walls, Gates:** Restrict unauthorized entry to facilities.
    * **Locks:** Secure doors, cabinets, and equipment.
    * **Security Guards:** Provide active surveillance and enforce access policies.
    * **Video Surveillance (CCTV):** Monitor and record activities for detection and deterrence.
    * **Access Badges/Cards:** Control entry to specific areas.
    * **Mantraps (Access Control Vestibules):** Two-door systems that only allow one door to open at a time, trapping individuals if they are unauthorized.
    * **Bollards:** Strong, short posts used to prevent vehicle attacks.
    * **Lighting:** Improves visibility for deterrence and detection.
    * **Environmental Controls:** Fire suppression systems, HVAC systems.

## Types of Security Controls (by Function)

Security controls can also be classified by the function they perform in relation to a security event or incident.

### 1. Preventive Controls

* **Definition:** Controls designed to deter or stop unauthorized access or activity from occurring in the first place. They are proactive measures.
* **Purpose:** To prevent security incidents.
* **Examples:**
    * **Firewalls:** Block malicious traffic before it enters the network.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Prevent unauthorized users from accessing resources.
    * **Strong Passwords / MFA:** Prevent unauthorized login attempts.
    * **Encryption:** Protects data even if it's accessed by unauthorized parties.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Educates users to avoid common attacks like phishing.
    * **Fencing and Locks:** Physically prevent unauthorized entry.

### 2. Deterrent Controls

* **Definition:** Controls designed to discourage potential attackers from attempting to breach security, often by making the attack seem too risky or difficult.
* **Purpose:** To discourage attacks.
    * *Note:* Deterrent controls often overlap with preventive and detective controls; their primary function is to change attacker behavior.
* **Examples:**
    * **Visible Security Cameras:** An attacker seeing cameras might decide not to proceed.
    * **Warning Signs / Legal Notices:** "Trespassers will be prosecuted."
    * **Security Guards:** Their presence can deter.
    * **Strong Encryption Notices:** Highlighting the difficulty of breaking the system.

### 3. Detective Controls

* **Definition:** Controls designed to identify and alert about security incidents or policy violations *after* they have occurred. They are reactive.
* **Purpose:** To detect security events and provide evidence.
* **Examples:**
    * **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Alert when suspicious activity is detected.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:** Aggregate and analyze logs for anomalies.
    * **Audit Logs:** Record system activities for later review.
    * **Video Surveillance (CCTV):** Records events that can be reviewed after a breach.
    * **Honeypots:** Decoy systems designed to attract and trap attackers, alerting defenders to their presence.
    * **Physical Alarms:** Triggered by unauthorized entry.

### 4. Corrective Controls

* **Definition:** Controls designed to mitigate the impact of a security incident, restore systems to normal operation, and fix vulnerabilities after an attack or breach.
* **Purpose:** To fix and recover.
* **Examples:**
    * **Backup and Recovery Systems:** Restore data and systems after a data loss event.
    * **Incident Response Teams (IRTs):** Take action to contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents.
    * **Patch Management:** Applying software updates to fix vulnerabilities discovered.
    * **Anti-malware Removal Tools:** Tools to remove malware infections.
    * **Forensics:** Investigating an incident to understand its scope and cause.

### 5. Compensating Controls

* **Definition:** Alternative security controls implemented when it is not feasible or practical to implement a primary control, or to provide an equivalent level of security.
* **Purpose:** To provide an alternative safeguard.
* **Examples:**
    * Using **MFA** for a legacy system that cannot support strong passwords.
    * **Increased physical patrols** in an area where advanced surveillance is not possible.
    * **Data encryption** at the application layer when network-level encryption is not available or insufficient.

### 6. Directive Controls

* **Definition:** Controls that define required actions or behaviors, instructing people to act in a certain way to meet security objectives.
* **Purpose:** To guide and direct behavior.
* **Examples:**
    * **Security Policies:** Formal documents outlining rules (e.g., "All employees must use strong passwords").
    * **Mandatory Security Awareness Training:** Requires employees to complete training.
    * **Compliance Regulations:** Laws or standards that mandate specific security practices (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    * **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Detailed instructions on how to perform security tasks.
