# 1.4 Explain the Importance of Using Appropriate Cryptographic Solutions

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (adversaries). It's crucial for achieving Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Non-repudiation.

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

PKI is a framework of policies, procedures, and technologies that enables the secure creation, management, distribution, use, storage, and revocation of digital certificates. It forms the basis for trust in many secure communications.

* **Public Key:** One of a pair of mathematically linked keys. It is freely shared and used to encrypt data or verify digital signatures.
* **Private Key:** The other key in the pair. It is kept secret by its owner and used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key or to create digital signatures.
* **Key Escrow:** A practice where cryptographic keys are held by a third party (an escrow agent) who can decrypt data on behalf of an organization, usually for legal or recovery purposes.

## Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

* **Level:**
    * **Full-disk:** Encrypts the entire hard drive, protecting all data at rest on the disk (e.g., BitLocker, VeraCrypt).
    * **Partition:** Encrypts a specific partition of a hard drive.
    * **File:** Encrypts individual files (e.g., EFS on Windows, GPG).
    * **Volume:** Encrypts a logical collection of storage, which may span multiple physical disks.
    * **Database:** Encrypts an entire database or specific fields within it.
    * **Record:** Encrypts individual records within a database.
* **Transport/Communication (Data in Transit):** Encrypts data as it moves across networks to secure communication channels (e.g., SSL/TLS for HTTPS, IPsec for VPNs).
* **Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Cryptography):**
    * Uses a pair of mathematically related keys (public and private).
    * One key encrypts, the other decrypts.
    * Used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and non-repudiation (e.g., RSA, ECC). Slower than symmetric for bulk data.
* **Symmetric Encryption (Secret-Key Cryptography):**
    * Uses a single, shared secret key for both encryption and decryption.
    * Faster than asymmetric encryption for large amounts of data.
    * Used for bulk data encryption (e.g., AES, DES, 3DES). Key distribution is a challenge.
* **Key Exchange:** The process by which two communicating parties securely establish a shared secret key (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, used within TLS handshakes).
* **Algorithms:** The mathematical rules or functions used for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, RSA, SHA, ECC).
* **Key Length:** The size of the key (measured in bits). Longer key lengths generally provide stronger encryption and are harder to crack through brute force (e.g., 128-bit AES, 2048-bit RSA).

## Cryptographic Tools

Hardware or software components designed to enhance or manage cryptographic operations.

* **Trusted Platform Module (TPM):** A secure cryptoprocessor on a motherboard that stores cryptographic keys, passwords, and digital certificates securely. Provides hardware-based security functions like secure boot and drive encryption.
* **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** A physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing. Used in servers for high-volume, high-security cryptographic operations (e.g., Certificate Authorities).
* **Key Management System (KMS):** A system designed to manage cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle (generation, storage, distribution, rotation, revocation, destruction). Crucial for maintaining security.
* **Secure Enclave:** A dedicated, isolated processing environment within a larger processor (e.g., in mobile devices) that provides enhanced security for sensitive data and operations, even if the main OS is compromised.

## Obfuscation

Techniques used to obscure or hide data, making it difficult to understand or analyze without affecting its actual functionality.

* **Steganography:** The art and science of hiding information within other, non-secret information (e.g., hiding a message in an image or audio file). The presence of the hidden message is often undetectable.
* **Tokenization:** The process of replacing sensitive data with a unique, non-sensitive identifier (a "token") that retains all the essential information about the data without compromising its security. The original data is stored securely elsewhere.
* **Data Masking:** Creating a structurally similar, but inauthentic, version of sensitive data. Used for development, testing, or training environments to protect real data while maintaining data utility.

## Hashing

* **Definition:** A one-way mathematical function that takes an input (data) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, called a hash value or message digest. It's computationally infeasible to reverse.
* **Purpose:** Primarily used for integrity checking (verifying data hasn't been altered) and password storage (storing hash of password, not password itself).
* **Properties:** Fixed output size, unique output for unique input, difficult to reverse, collision resistance (hard to find two inputs that produce the same hash).

## Salting

* **Definition:** Adding a unique, random string of data (the "salt") to a password before it is hashed.
* **Purpose:** To protect against rainbow table attacks and ensure that two identical passwords have different hash values, even if stored in the same database.

## Digital Signatures

* **Definition:** A cryptographic technique used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or the creator of a document, and to ensure the integrity of the message/document. Created by hashing data and encrypting the hash with the sender's private key.
* **Purpose:** Provides authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.

## Key Stretching

* **Definition:** A technique used to make a weak or short password more resistant to brute-force attacks by increasing the computational effort required to hash it (e.g., by adding multiple rounds of hashing, often combined with salting).
* **Algorithms:** PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt.

## Blockchain

* **Definition:** A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in blocks, which are then linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, making it resistant to modification.
* **Purpose:** Provides transparency, security, and decentralization, typically used for cryptocurrencies but also for supply chain, identity management, etc.

## Open Public Ledger

* **Definition:** A type of distributed ledger technology (like blockchain) that is openly accessible and viewable by anyone, typically with transactions being pseudonymous.
* **Purpose:** Transparency and immutability.

## Certificates

Digital certificates are electronic documents used to prove the ownership of a public key. They are a core component of PKI.

* **Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Trusted third-party organizations that issue and manage digital certificates. They bind a public key to an identity.
* **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs):** A list maintained by a CA of certificates that it has issued but that are no longer valid (e.g., due to a compromised private key or expired certificate).
* **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** An alternative to CRLs, allowing
