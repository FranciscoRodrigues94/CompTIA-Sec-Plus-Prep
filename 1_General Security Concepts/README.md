# 01 - General Security Concepts

This folder contains detailed study notes for the foundational concepts of cybersecurity, aligning with the initial objectives of the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam's Domain 1: General Security Concepts.
The topics covered here are essential for building a strong understanding of security principles before delving into specific attack types and vulnerabilities.
