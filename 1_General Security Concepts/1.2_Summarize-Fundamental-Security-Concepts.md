# 1.2 Summarize Fundamental Security Concepts

Understanding the foundational concepts of security is paramount to building a robust cybersecurity posture and effectively analyzing risks. This document outlines key principles and common technologies.

## Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)

The CIA Triad is a foundational model for cybersecurity, representing the three core goals of information security.

* **Confidentiality:** Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. It aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.
    * **Examples:** Encryption (data at rest or in transit), Access Control Lists (ACLs), strong authentication mechanisms, data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.
* **Integrity:** Guarantees that information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, ensuring its accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
    * **Examples:** Hashing (verifying file integrity), digital signatures, checksums, version control systems, access controls that restrict modification.
* **Availability:** Ensures that systems, applications, and data are accessible to authorized users when needed. It aims to prevent service disruptions.
    * **Examples:** Redundancy (failover systems, redundant power supplies), backups and disaster recovery plans (DRPs), load balancing, high-availability clusters.

## Non-repudiation

* **Definition:** Provides undeniable proof that an action or event has occurred and cannot be disputed by the involved parties. It ensures that the sender of a message or the performer of an action cannot later deny having sent or performed it.
* **Importance:** Crucial for legal and audit trails, holding individuals accountable for their actions.
* **Examples:** Digital signatures (providing proof of origin and integrity), audit logs (recording actions performed by users or systems).

## Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

AAA is a framework for controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing information necessary to bill for services.

* **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device. It answers the question "Who are you?".
    * **Authenticating People:**
        * **Something you know:** Passwords, PINs.
        * **Something you have:** Smart cards, tokens, mobile devices (for MFA).
        * **Something you are:** Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition).
        * **Somewhere you are:** Geolocation.
        * **Something you do:** Keystroke dynamics, voice patterns.
    * **Authenticating Systems:**
        * Certificates (e.g., in PKI, for machine authentication).
        * API keys.
        * SSH keys (for server access).
* **Authorization:** The process of determining what an authenticated user or system is permitted to do or access within a system. It answers the question "What are you allowed to do?".
    * **Authorization Models:**
        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles. (e.g., "Admin" role, "User" role).
        * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Access decisions are based on attributes of the subject (user), object (resource), action, and environment. (e.g., "Only managers in department X can access project Y between 9 AM and 5 PM").
        * **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** The owner of a resource determines permissions.
        * **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** Access is controlled by system-wide policies, typically used in highly secure environments (e.g., military).
* **Accounting (Auditing):** The process of tracking user activities and resource consumption. It answers the question "What did you do?".
    * **Importance:** Provides an audit trail for security investigations, compliance, and billing.
    * **Examples:** System logs, security event logs, network flow records.

## Gap Analysis

* **Definition:** A comparison of actual performance with potential or desired performance. In security, it involves identifying the gap between an organization's current security posture and its desired security posture (e.g., adherence to a specific framework like NIST or ISO 27001).
* **Purpose:** To identify areas where security controls are missing or inadequate, and to prioritize investments in security improvements.

## Zero Trust

* **Definition:** A security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that no user, device, or network is inherently trustworthy, whether inside or outside the organizational perimeter. Every access request is authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated.
* **Core Principle:** "Verify explicitly, use least privilege access, assume breach."
* **Components/Concepts:**
    * **Control Plane:** The decision-making part of the Zero Trust architecture.
        * **Adaptive Identity:** Continuous verification of user identity based on context (location, device posture, behavior).
        * **Threat Scope Reduction:** Minimizing the attack surface by granting access only to specific resources for specific tasks.
        * **Policy-driven Access Control:** Access decisions are made dynamically based on granular policies.
        * **Policy Administrator:** The component responsible for defining and managing access policies.
        * **Policy Engine:** The component that evaluates access requests against established policies.
    * **Data Plane:** The enforcement part of the Zero Trust architecture, where access decisions are applied.
        * **Implicit Trust Zones:** Eliminated; no network segment is inherently trusted.
        * **Subject/System:** Any user, device, or application requesting access to a resource.
        * **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** The component that enforces the access decision made by the Policy Engine (e.g., a gateway, firewall, or API proxy).

## Physical Security

* **Definition:** Measures designed to protect physical assets (e.g., buildings, hardware, personnel) from unauthorized physical access, damage, or theft.
* **Importance:** A critical layer of defense, as breaches can start with physical access.
* **Examples:**
    * **Bollards:** Strong, short posts often used to prevent vehicles from ramming into buildings or restricted areas.
    * **Access Control Vestibule (Man-trap):** A small room with two doors, where the first door must close before the second one opens, often used to control one person's entry at a time and for verification.
    * **Fencing:** Physical barriers to deter and delay unauthorized entry to premises.
    * **Video Surveillance (CCTV):** Cameras that record activity, used for monitoring, deterrence, and evidence collection.
    * **Security Guard:** Human presence for active monitoring, enforcement of policies, and response to incidents.
    * **Access Badge:** Electronic cards or physical tokens used to grant access through controlled entry points.
    * **Lighting:** Well-lit areas deter crime and improve visibility for surveillance.
    * **Sensors:** Devices that detect changes in the environment to trigger alarms.
        * **Infrared:** Detects changes in heat (body heat).
        * **Pressure:** Detects weight changes (e.g., pressure pads under mats).
        * **Microwave:** Detects motion by sending out microwave signals and analyzing reflections.
        * **Ultrasonic:** Detects motion using high-frequency sound waves.

## Deception and Disruption Technology

* **Definition:** Technologies used to mislead, lure, or misdirect attackers to gain intelligence about their methods and motives, or to disrupt their attacks.
* **Purpose:** To detect attackers early, collect threat intelligence, and waste attacker resources.
* **Examples:**
    * **Honeypot:** A decoy system designed to attract and trap potential attackers, appearing to be a legitimate, vulnerable target. No legitimate traffic should ever interact with a honeypot.
    * **Honeynet:** A network of honeypots, simulating a larger, more complex network to observe attacker behavior on a broader scale.
    * **Honeyfile:** A decoy file designed to attract unauthorized access. Alerts are triggered if the file is accessed or modified.
    * **Honeytoken:** A decoy piece of data (e.g., a fake database record, a bogus password hash) planted within a legitimate system to detect unauthorized access or exfiltration. If the token is used or moved, an alert is triggered.
